<p><em>But, as Joe Sparrow found out, if you <strong>really</strong> want to experience the world beyond your expiry date, you'll need to take slightly more drastic steps...</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="physicaldeathisaconceptwerenotdesignedtounderstand">Physical death is a concept we’re not designed to understand.</h2>
<p>Despite this, we spend our lives trying to figure it out (hello, philosophy!), mitigate against it (hey, religion!), or find mortal witnesses to our actions (hey, marriage, fame, ego!).</p>
<p>These are all human foibles - but there are a group of people for whom life is simply not enough, and who find death unpalatable.</p>
<p><strong>So, they’re gambling, and the payoff is great: life after death</strong>. And after reading this, you might want to join them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="waltandpeace">Walt and Peace</h2>
<p><em>Nope. I’m not going to mention him</em>, I thought. It’s far too obvious and old and boring. It’s not even true! So I’m not going to mention him.</p>
<p>And yet, here we are, blithely incorporating Walt Disney’s name at the start of a piece about Cryonics – the art of freezing dead people in order for their brains or bodies to be reanimated when future science can muster up the chops.</p>
<p>And Walt - well, everyone knows that he’s the most famous exponent of course; chilled to somewhere near zero Kelvin in a Californian warehouse.</p>
<p>Except… he’s not. He’s <a href="www.disneyavenue.com/2015/07/walt-disneys-cryogenically-frozen-urban.html">really</a>, <a href="www.snopes.com/disney/waltdisn/frozen.asp">really</a>, <a href="mentalfloss.com/article/54196/disney-ice-truth-about-walt-disney-and-cryogenics">really</a> not.</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:60%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/tfQQpE0KDPuPm" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/walt-disney-tfQQpE0KDPuPm">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Even the then-president of the California Cryogenics Society, said as much to the <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/no-walt-disney-isnt-cryogenically-frozen-1665231394">Los Angeles Times</a> upon the animator’s death in 1966:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is, Walt missed out. He never specified it in writing, and when he died the family didn't go for it. They had him cremated. I personally have seen his ashes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Walt was <em>interested</em>, and why let the truth get in the way of a good story?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="theultimategamble">The ultimate gamble</h2>
<blockquote class='rg_standalone_container' data-src='//genius.com/annotations/762731/standalone_embed'><a href='https://genius.com/762731/Beastie-boys-cant-wont-and-dont-stop-grasshopper-unit/Like-walt-disney-hell-be-frozen'>Like Walt Disney he&#39;ll be frozen</a><br><a href='https://genius.com/Beastie-boys-cant-wont-and-dont-stop-grasshopper-unit-lyrics'>&#8213; Beastie Boys (Ft. Biz Markie) – Can't, Won't And Don't Stop/Grasshopper Unit</a></blockquote><script async crossorigin src='//genius.com/annotations/load_standalone_embeds.js'></script>
<p><strong>Even if we are to believe the paragon of truthiness that are the Beastie Boys</strong> – who mentioned Disney’s rumoured current chilly disposition in song – the likelihood of ol’ Walt being re-activated is slim.</p>
<p>It’s the ultimate gamble. But it’s not even the type of gamble that would make a Premiership footballer baulk: the Cryonics Institute offers their services for <a href="http://www.cryonics.org/the-ci-advantage/">a one-off fee for $28,000</a>. (Consider that Wayne Rooney allegedly blew <a href="https://www.metro.news/wayne-rooney-blew-500000-in-two-hours-betting-on-casino-tables/601418/">half a million pounds in one evening)</a></p>
<p>It’s also probably worth differentiating between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics">Cryogenics</a> - the act of making things very, very cold indeed - which is often confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics">Cryonics</a> - the act of making <em>people</em> very, very cold indeed.</p>
<p>But how is it supposed to work? And why are <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html">some very smart people</a> signing up for the deep-freeze?</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how it works</strong>. First, you write a water-tight will explaining you want to be frozen. You deal with the family members and complete strangers who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/us/cancer-immortality-cryogenics.html">queue up to criticise you</a>. Maybe you upload your mind to something <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs">a bit like a Brain-Dropbox</a> so that it can be re-downloaded later; the ultimate wipe-and-reset procedure.</p>
<p>And then, moments after you finally croak, the mourning relatives are nudged unceremoniously out of the way, so that your cooling corpse can be slung on a slab and drained of the pesky liquids (you are 70% water; water expands when it freezes; it turns out that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/18/cryogenics-does-it-offer-humanity-a-chance-to-return-from-the-dead">this is a bad thing in this instance</a>).</p>
<p>You’re then frozen, sharpish, so that hopefully any lingering memories are retained in your brain, and popped into a giant Thermos flask full of liquid nitrogen and other frozen people.</p>
<p>And then… you wait. (Better hope that there’s not a massive earthquake under your storage facility in the next thousand years. Or a power cut. Or a war.)</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/WLmVO7dRuNaCI" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/arnold-schwarzenegger-mr-freeze-batman-WLmVO7dRuNaCI">via GIPHY</a></p> 
<p><strong>So how long is that wait?</strong> Well, here’s the fun part: <em>who knows</em>?<br>
We’re only just getting somewhere with preserving individual organs for <a href="https://futurism.com/4-scientists-have-found-a-way-to-rapidly-thaw-cryopreserved-tissue-without-damage/">more than a few hours</a>, so it’s gonna be a while.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Cryonics is based around some unconventional scientific wisdom and a few big assumptions: that memories are held in the brain long enough after death to make preserving the grey matter worthwhile, and that science will one day be advanced enough to re-activate your body.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="theultimatestatussymbol">The ultimate status symbol</h2>
<p><strong>To a “maker” in the anything’s-possible</strong>, <em>bodies-are-just-another-dumb-thing-to-be-#disrupted</em> culture of Silicon Valley, the hard limits of human life are, at the least, an inefficient inconvenience.</p>
<p>But disrupting death isn’t just an inevitable streamlining of a broken supply chain - it’s messing with a system that’s worked really well for the last four billion years, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Cryonics is based around some unconventional scientific wisdom and a few big assumptions: that memories are held in the brain long enough after death to make preserving the grey matter worthwhile, and that science will one day be advanced enough to re-activate your body.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why cryonics is a pretty uncommon procedure: right now, less than 300 people are lingering in the ultimate chill-out room, although a few thousand have signed up to be let behind the velvet rope.</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Lgb9p7eXSEcp2" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/is-this-real-life-david-after-dentist-Lgb9p7eXSEcp2">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p><strong>And yet, others argue, it’s madness that we don’t all put our names down right away</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Argument A: it’s super cheap.</strong> No, really. I worked it out on the back of an envelope and I’m not 100% sure why I’m not saving for it already, considering the possible advantages.</p>
<p>If it costs $28,000 to be frozen today, then if I live to 100, and inflation is roughly 3%, it’ll cost $185,669 when I pop my clogs. If I saved a couple of dollars a day between now and then, in an account with a decent compound interest rate, I’d have enough Death Dollars for the Freezer Procedure – with plenty to spare for a decent buffet at the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>Argument B: the odds are with you, and it’s the biggest prize-pot of all.</strong> Nearly a quarter of a million dollars does seem like a massive amount of money to gamble on an unproven half-idea. But if Cryogenics has even only a 1% chance of working, you have a chance. And the other option, death, is famously certain in its finality.</p>
<p>So given the urgency we all have, as slobbering animals, to keep on living at any cost, Cryonics does seem like a rather prudent option. And it’s a better daily investment than a Vanilla Latte.</p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:54%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HRekieRjRBd7i" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/televandalist-monty-python-HRekieRjRBd7i">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p><strong>Thus, with logical feasibility out of the way</strong>, here’s an interesting ethical question: is being brought back to life after death <em>not just incredibly greedy</em>?</p>
<p>Our world is crowded with too many people as it is. Surely one more person - a <em>special exception</em> from hundreds of years in the past – wouldn’t make a difference to a crowded world, right? (For one answer, see the above visual representation of the outcome of <em>just one more</em>.)</p>
<p>Is it worth pausing to consider that maybe choosing not to live forever is a <em>kinder</em> thing to do? You didn’t choose to be here in the first place: maybe getting picky now is the ultimate solipsistic statement.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons surround us:</strong> if you want an example of powerful people making difficult but technically possible gambles in order to enrich their own lives over others, look no further than Wall Street in 2008 – and try not to forget the billions whose lives were made worse as a result.</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:76%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6JY1Jo2lwnBSM" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7151009/watch-the-recession-hit-the-us-in-one-terrifying-30-second-gif">Job Losses following the Great Recession,  via Vox</a></p>
<p><strong>But wait! There’s more!</strong> What if your memories didn’t make it and you were resurrected with the brain of a dribbling newborn?</p>
<p>Or what if the future simply sucks: not in a doom-and-gloom, gloop-and-electrodes Matrix way, but a world where the only music available was Ed Sheeran ballads?</p>
<p>What if the scientists of 2934 couldn’t bring your memories back, so kindly implanted the brain pattern of the earth’s most powerful person at your time of death - and you were stuck with the mentality of Donald Trump?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="greatscott">Great Scott!</h2>
<p><strong>Cryogenics is, in a way, a type of time travel.</strong> And, just like Marty McFly, no-one’s really sure where you’ll end up. But be sure that, if it works, it’ll probably not be in a family-friendly romp about resisting your mother’s romantic advances.</p>
<p>And here the biggest potential irony of all awaits Cryonics-advocates. It’s a thought that’ll zap a jolt of nightsweat-inducing fear through their mortal meat-bags: the scientists of the future will be <em>more than capable</em> of bringing you back to life – but why would they choose bring someone as greedy <em>as you</em> into their utopian, selfless, thoughtful world?</p>
<p>For the people making these ruthlessly logical and chilly gambles, it turns out that embracing the unknown needs to be part of the fun after all.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Still hankering to be frozen forever</strong>? Until then, why not <a href="https://getgrover.com/de-de/gaming-and-vr/virtual-reality">rent the latest VR tech</a> and experience some alternate realities today?</p>
