          <p><strong>Disclaimer: this is going to get very weird, very fast</strong>. Maybe by now, you’ve tried VR in the guise of <a href="https://getgrover.com/de/categories/virtual-reality#view_available">Oculus Rift or HTC Vive</a> (if not, you can try it out easily - <a href="https://getgrover.com/de/categories/virtual-reality#view_available">here</a>).</p>
<p>It’s worth getting the practice in now, because by 2040, we’ll most probably be spending most of our time in &quot;full-immersion virtual reality&quot;. Or at least, that's what Transhumanists think.</p>
<p>But don’t fret. Being able to keep ourselves occupied will be useful, because by 2045, the <em>Singularity</em> will happen, and suddenly we won't be the smartest thing on the planet any more.</p>
<p>Oh, and you’re going to live forever too. Told you it was going to get weird.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="transhumanistsareveryseriouspeople">Transhumanists are Very Serious People.</h3>
<p><strong>Yes, they laugh and joke like you and me</strong>, but fundamentally, they’re dealing with Big Ideas that are So Big, they may not care about the latest Donald Trump gif from your WhatsApp chatroom.</p>
<p>Transhumanists would happily come to the pub with you, but conversation would probably drift pretty quickly from football to the concept of, <a href="http://whatistranshumanism.org">you know, <em>living forever.</em></a></p>
<p>That’s why they’re so serious. Life itself is at stake. Not just <em>their</em> lives - all of humanity’s. Transhumanists have realised that maybe – just maybe – they’ve been born just in time to merge with technology that’s around the corner.</p>
<p>But maybe we should put the jokes aside for a moment too. Transhumanism is also based around one very simple idea, that we can all get on board with immediately: <em>hey, what if we just didn’t die?</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bloodisthickerthanourtech">Blood is thicker than our tech</h3>
<p><strong>Transhumanism is, at its core, the idea of taking technology and creating <em>Humanity+</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Or to put it another way, becoming post-human. Transhumanists’ aim of meshing dumb brains, weak flesh and smart technology is partly driven by enthusiasm at making humans live longer and be <em>better</em>; and partly resignation: <em>it’s going to happen anyway, so we may as well get on with it.</em></p>
<p>Humanity+ might not be the better you that you want (I'd be happy to stop at having blonder hair or a less enormous nose) but it’s going to be the one that you’ll get.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you replace all of your brain matter with nanite technology – and you’re still aware of being you, just smarter – would you really care?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the benefits will be tech marvels: struggling to learn German? Some microscopic machines in your brain will re-wire those synapses for you - it’s <em>unglaublich einfach</em>!</p>
<p>The Transhumanism timeline goes big, fast. The assumption is that the leaps in tech evolution are going to become a series of ever-faster blurs, and in the end you won’t understand them.</p>
<p>Take those brainy nanobots, <em>Deutsch sprechen für dich in deinem kopf</em>: those machine-neurones are better than the fleshy ones ones you grew up with – so why keep the stupid ones?</p>
<p>If you replace all of your brain matter with nanite technology – and you’re still aware of being you, just smarter – would you really care?</p>
<p>And with big idea like that at its core, Transhumanism philosophy follows a similar exponential curve to the technology it predicts.</p>
<p>One moment, you’re marvelling over <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/in-a-win-for-artificial-intelligence-google-computer-program-defeats-chinese-go-master/">a computer beating a human at Go</a>, and the next, the world's turning into a giant computer, human beings are turning into pure intelligence, and intelligence itself is colonising the universe at light speed.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="unashamedaboutray">Unashamed About Ray</h3>
<p><strong>One name that crops up time and time again when you reach into the world of Transhumanism is Ray Kurzweil.</strong> If Transhumanists are essentially becoming <em>human+</em> – their own gods – then Ray is God+. Tranhumanist-in-chief. The man they’ll follow into infinity.</p>
<p>Scientist, inventor, innovator, thinker, author, futurist: most mere mortals struggle to relate to Ray.</p>
<p>His more prosaic work has involved changing the world. He’s created machines that copy human skills: looking, reading and speaking. He invented the charge-coupled device flatbed scanner, the omni-font optical character recognition technology, the first print-to-speech reading machine for blind people, and the first commercial text-to-speech synthesizer.</p>
<p>He’s been peppered with awards from Presidents, has scooped up 21 honorary doctorates and is generally recognised as a living, breathing genius.</p>
<p>And remarkably, for Transhumanists, this work is not the reason he’s worshipped.</p>
<p>Because Ray’s also written a series of best-selling books that bridge technology and health with provocative titles like <em>The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</em> and <em>Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever</em>.</p>
<p>Transhumanists love Ray because his message is: hey, chill – we’re gonna live forever, whether you want to or not.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Here’s an idea.</strong> If you <em>do</em> want to live forever, you’re going to need a lot of cash. So Transhumanists could do worse than dropping Ray an email and asking him what next week’s lottery numbers are.</p>
<p>Why? Because since the early 1990s, he’s made a series of rational, measured predictions that have eerily come to pass almost exactly how and when he described.</p>
<p>He’s made so many correct predictions that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil">the Wikipedia page devoted to them</a> is longer than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostradamus">that of Nostradamus</a>. (Although it’s still not as long as the Wikipedia entry for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_Five-0_(2010_TV_series)">TV remake of <em>Hawaii Five-0</em></a>, because Wikipedia.)</p>
<p><strong>In 1990, in one single book, he correctly predicted:</strong> the fall of the USSR, and the liberating, educating role technology would play in its demise; that by 2000, a computer would beat a chess grandmaster (IBM’s Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1997); and that, by the early 21st Century, we’d all be hooked up to the internet via wireless connections.</p>
<p>Aware of his gift, and a master of publicity, Ray’s kept a running total of his successes: in 2009, by his count, 102 out of 108 of his predictions had come true.</p>
<p>So when Ray Kurzweil says that by 2039, we’ll be able to upload our brains to a computer and humans will be able to become “software-based”, we should probably take a moment to digest the news as a likely outcome.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="asingularprediction">A singular prediction</h3>
<p><strong>If it feels like the Qatar World Cup is a long way away</strong>, maybe it’s time to readdress your interpretation of time, the universe, and everything. Here's where the weird things start to get really weird.</p>
<p>And there’ll be no going back to how it was before.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">The Singularity</a> is an idea that Ray, and Transhumanists, toy with a lot, for good reason. It’s the point when technology takes over; when our technology gets smarter than us, and then starts making smart changes we’re not smart enough to understand.</p>
<p>BTW, It’s pencilled in for 2045. Better bring the washing in before the end of the world starts.</p>
<p>Oh, right - the Singularity essentially means the end of humanity. IN the &quot;plus&quot; column, it might also be the end of some more trivial ideas like “death”, “time”, “perception”, and “space” too.</p>
<p>Your question now is: what does “humanity” mean when being human isn’t confined to that boring and limiting <em>born-live-die</em> one-way curve? What if you and your conscious mind could be copied and pasted from that meat-bag you’re in now and into a shiny new device? The battery life would be better, at least.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Here’s some more predictions that Ray has made that you should probably pop into your phone’s calendar right now</strong>, as a fun way to mark off the days to the big jump to Humanity 2.0.:</p>
<p><strong>2018</strong>: Let’s start with a blooper: Ray predicted that in 2018 ten terabytes of computer memory - about the same size as the human brain’s capacity - should cost a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Hey, we’re ahead of ourselves - <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Description=10tb%20hard%20drive&amp;Submit=ENE">you can pick up a 10tB drive for $400 right now.</a> Durrr, Ray!</p>
<p><strong>2020s</strong>: Don’t get too smug at Ray’s previous swing and a miss, because in the next decade, we’ll be able to buy a computer as smart as a human brain for that same $1000.</p>
<p>And once computers start getting smart, it’s curtains for humanity as we know it: after that, they’re smarter than us, building better versions of themselves - and then they’re in control. But hey, for a thousand bucks, that's a bargain!</p>
<p><strong>2030-2050</strong>: Ray’s pretty sure that a thousand dollars is going to get more <em>meaningful</em> in what it can buy. At this point, it’ll buy a computer a billion times smarter than <em>all of us put together</em>.</p>
<p>Other trifling changes in this period include the one where humans <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_fog">stop being flesh, and start being fog</a>. Quick reminder: we’re also living forever at this point.</p>
<p>All those people who told you it was great to be alive in the swingin’ Sixties sound a bit silly now, don’t they?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="intothefuture">Into the future</h3>
<p><strong>Fog-bodies, everlasting life (except you won’t recognise it as such) and Matrix-like VR compliancy.</strong> In conclusion: it’s all rather terrifying. Or exhilarating. Or maybe it’s just that we’re too dumb to understand it all.</p>
<p>So it’s probably worth <a href="https://getgrover.com/de/categories/virtual-reality#view_available">getting acquainted with VR right now</a>, and you can work your way up to replacing your body with smart fog later. But for now, at the very least, make sure you keep your phone OS up-to-date.</p>
