If you've worked in food service, you know that it can make you feel somewhat robotic.
In addition to the pre-programmed and often repetitive nature of customer interactions (there are only so many times per day a person can say "How can I help you?" and really mean it), monotonous tasks like making coffees, flipping burgers, or pouring beers seem like they could be done just as well by a machine.
Today these tasks are starting to become automated, with varying degrees of success. Robo-baristas, grill-bots, and mecha-bartenders are on their way to one million served. But they're not quite there yet.
Beep boop beep boop beep, I'm lovin' it



Miso Robotics' Flippy is a robot specifically designed to cook hamburgers. Depending on the rate at which kitchen staff keep putting raw patties in front of it, Flippy can cook 150 to 300 burgers an hour.
Flippy has learning capabilities that Miso claims allow it to learn from its surroundings and from kitchen staff, but the extent of its thirst for knowledge is unclear, and having only one spatula-equipped arm makes it seem unsuited for too many additional tasks besides its sole goal of consistently producing perfect pucks of meat. However, it does have the capability to swap its own tools using a pneumatic pump system, which, imagining a robot self-equipping kitchen knives, is terrifying.



Another iteration of Flippy has a crab-claw-like scoop:



MIT Tech Review reports that a Flippy robot costs $60,000 and that it is currently working only 10.5 hours per week at CaliBurger in Pasadena, California - a far cry from the $8.28 average hourly wage for fast food workers.
The satirical website News Examiner announced that McDonald's was planning to open its first entirely robot-run establishment in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as 25,000 additional locations by the end of 2016. Don't let the very convincing image of a McDonald's-branded burger bot fool you, though, the article is a confirmed hoax.
However, the quote from the article's (fake) McDonald's manager ("These things are great! They get their work done in a fast and orderly manner, plus they don’t ask for cigarette breaks.") isn't far from what an actual former McDonald's CEO said in response to the announcement of a real robot-run restaurant - this one by Momentum Machines and located (where else?) in San Francisco: "It’s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who’s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging French fries."
So there may be robotic helpers in the McKitchen of the future. And as gross as that statement from the ex-CEO about the value of fast food workers is, it overlooks some other potential problems with having robots make our fast food, as pointed out by rival burger chain Carl's Jr.:



Caffeine.exe
The robo-barista nicknamed Gordon at Cafe X makes a "dang good latte" according to Wired.
And they're stylish, too - a lot of research went into humanizing the robot arms' mannerisms. The smooth movements, swirling of the cup, and friendly "wave" give the Cafe X bots a bit of panache and personality (which is generally hard to convey without a face):



Cafe X isn't the first or only café to take on the challenge of caffeine infusion automation - Beijing's Bubble Lab has created a pour-over robot called Drip:



In partnership with Kalita, they created this absolutely mesmerizing promo:



Bubble Labs also built a robot that serves soft serve cones, and although the following video is in Chinese, it's pretty easy to understand without translating (cute girl presses buttons, machine arm delivers soft serve):



But it wouldn't be a MONTAG article unless we found some way to make this situation dystopian. It's all cute until the robots get a little bit more demanding about your need for sweet treats, as in this Halo Top promotion by Mike Diva:



Sir Mix-A-Bot
Robot bartenders are a great science fiction trope - the most recent one that comes to mind is Michael Sheen's android bartender Arthur from the 2016 film Passengers. Most real-life drink-slinging bots aren't quite as eager to dispense wisdom, but (more importantly) they can dispense drinks.
Makr Shakr's robotic arm system has been deployed on both a highly technologically advanced cruise ship, and in the capital city of gimmicky watering holes, Las Vegas:



You may be thinking: KUKA robot arms again? They play ping pong, they can dance, make music, and help send season's greetings... Come on, what haven't we seen them do? And who can afford one?
For the thirsty makers out there, Naomi Wu hosts a tutorial on building a bar bot controlled by Arduino that can mix 16 different cocktails. Find instructions here on Github and on Open Builds, or follow her video tutorials:



It doesn't have as much personality as an android, but that could be for the best. According to Isaac Asimov's three laws, an intelligent robot shouldn't be capable of serving us intoxicants anyway:



The obligatory "they're taking our jobs!" wrap-up
No, they're not. Not yet, at least.
While automated burger flippers, glorified vending machines with robot arms for coffee and ice cream, and drink-dispensing mechanisms with or without circuit-frying ethical conflicts have all been proven, they haven't been proven at scale.
And although food service jobs like these can be repetitive and laborious, we're not ready to trust robots with such basic tasks as feeding us. It can all go so wrong, so fast.

To say that happiness is the point of life is almost too glib to be a point even worth debating. We all want to be happy, more than anything else. Even typing that sentence feels superfluous. No-one, even Morrissey, truly wants to be unhappy. But when arranging our society, we come over with a case of the Testosterone Vapours and abandon fluffy things like “being happy” and prioritise Big, Strong and Very Successful things like - sigh - money.When we measure success on a large scale - like countries or businesses - we generally ignore happiness. Instead, we measure things like Gross National Product, which is the value of all the stuff a country and its people makes, or obsess over the stock market, which is basically trainspotting for obscenely rich people.The unspoken assumption is that the bigger these big numbers, the happier the associated people will be, because why on earth would these people be busy doing all of that success if it was not with the ultimate aim of being happier?(Actually, there’s a whole bunch of reasons people work hard to make loads of money, like fear, uncertainty, and a desperation to please others - no-one of which are closely connected to the pursuit of happiness.)So what if we made being happy the big, top-line measurement instead? Well, there’s a few huge, glittery questions that linger in the corner of the room when we discuss the state-level persuit of happiness. Here they are: we all want to be happy… but how does “prioritising” happiness make any difference? Doesn’t happiness come as a result of other things? Isn’t happiness a result of lots of nice things all happening at once? And how the f*ck is that going to happen in a world like the one we have in 2019?H.O.M.E.The second level of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is “Safety”, and under this heading is the human need for a material home space. Another of the 20th century’s great thinkers - Matt Goss from '80s UK boyband BROS - opined, “the letters, ‘H’, ‘O’, ‘M’, ‘E’ are so important because they personify the word ‘home’.” The clear conclusion of these titans of thought? Home is extremely important to finding happiness.Tell that to the 100,000 people of Bhutan - one-sixth of the population - who had their nationality taken away from them because of their ethic Nepalese origin, and were forced to flee their homeland.It’s somewhat ironic, then, that Bhutan is the only country in the world to include an index of national happiness - its “GNH” or Gross National Happiness - in the legal operation of the country. The Gross National Happiness Commission uses “Screening Tools” to decide whether governmental policies and projects add or detract from the happiness of its people (the ones it hasn’t unceremoniously expelled, obvs.)Bhutan’s GNH thingy is not, apparently, merely a nice and cuddly distraction to make us look the other way while horrible things are done to innocent people. (Although it's worth noting that a future career in PR could await its policymakers, if the breathless western media coverage of GNH is anything to go by.)Supposedly a series of measurable data points, it's based on detailed surveys of the population which check in on, amongst other things, their psychological well-being, education, and, erm, cultural diversity. The government then says it uses this data to benchmark progress and make future policy decisions.It’s certainly a nice idea, and is an admirable way of analysing people and decision, and as Pharrell pointed out, “Happiness is the truth.” But could it happen in our countries, which seem locked into the GNP cycle?A Gross Domestic ProjectIf you think that putting happiness front and centre in our decision-making is the kind of kale-eating, yoghurt-knitting, vegan-sausage-roll-chewing pinko nonsense that is turning our frogs gay… then you’d be dead wrong. Because the current measures of a country’s success is the amount of dough we have, any conversation about prioritising happiness quickly veers off into areas you may not instinctively associate with happiness, like collective bargaining, higher taxes, and ending capitalism. We have historically used GNP as the main measurement because - and this part still actually kind-of makes sense, folks - a high number means we have lots of things that allow you to buy other things. And the reason people choose to spend money is to make themselves happy! That’s why you need money to get indisputably happiness-bringing stuff like holidays, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, and puppies.But lots and lots of money has resulted in the need to invent increasingly spurious reasons to spend all that excess money. That’s why things like gender-reveal cakes, the iPotty, and Chris Brown exist.And the reason they exist is because it turns out that once you bought that thing you wanted, the little spike of acquistion-happiness goes pretty quickly. Therefore, our lizard-brain reasoning goes, we need to buy more stuff to get another hit o’ happy... and the cycle continues.Incidentally, the perpetual need to keep on buying stuff is also one of the necessary components of our late-stage capitalist culture, which is something we measure via GDP. Huh.What Money Does For PeopleThe wider world is now embracing a more open analysis of happiness. The UN now issues a regular World Happiness Report, and yes, of course Finland is the happiest country.Meanwhile, the hopeful souls of Gross National Happiness USA are serious about happiness - and aim to change how progress and success is measured: “Rather than base policy and individual choice on a Gross National Product paradigm with its insistent focus on money, growth and materialism, we propose instead a more encompassing Gross National Happiness paradigm, which includes many factors that support true wellbeing for all people and the planet.”This… sounds just fine, actually.It’s easy to be cynical when taking seriously the idea of putting happiness first at a governmental level. We can all imagine that one dickhead who will take advantage, rule the vulnerable with fear, and f*ck us all by transmogrifying our nice, happy future into Capitalism 2.0.Or maybe not. The most telling part of the GNH story is how deeply a “happiness-first” holistic approach to life resonates with people from financially wealthy countries: the ones with a sparkling GDP and an unhappy populace, dismayed to fing that chasing money and spending it might be a race to the bottom of the happiness pit.So perhaps the time is right: when was the last time the world’s economy and political system was in such flux-like upheaval? Has humanity ever been better-educated, able to expound their own radical ideas and create new movements from their sofa? If enough people can agree, huge changes to policy and decision-making can be made in a snap - as the Brexiteers of the UK are finding out, with, admittedly, mixed effects on their happiness.And what about our happiness pioneers over in Bhutan? In the UN’s 2018 World Happiness Report, when countries were ranked by happiness, Bhutan romped home 97th out of 156.

Experiencing a video game world, as filtered through the on-screen avatar, is a situation familiar to millions of gamers. So familiar, in fact, that it's easy to underestimate the importance of experiencing a world in, essentially, another body.
Millions of teenage boys playing Tomb Raider, for instance, are experiencing the world as woman (albeit a fantasy woman in a virtual world.) So what does this do to our understanding of the real world - and how does it make us cyborgs?

Understanding the Cyborg
The word “cyborg” originates from a novel combination of the words “cybernetic” and “organism” by the scientist, inventor, and musician Manfred Clynes in the year 1960. Although most people now think of a cyborg as some science fictional fusion of man and machine, it was coined to describe the artificial life-support systems necessary to support human space travel.
In this interpretation, the human being – equipped to float in space and umbilically tethered to the mother ship – is totally encased in a simulation of Earth, complete with atmospheric pressure, breathable air, water, heat insulation, and communications, among other necessities.
It is not surprising that pioneers of cyberspace have also found this term useful for navigating an embodied experience online, in Earth-bound virtual realities. In his book Cyborg Citizen: Politics in the Posthuman Age, Chris Hables Gray explained how being an “online cyborg” felt:
“Five or six hours of being cyborged on-line had incredible effects on my body. When I walked outside into the rain, I felt lighter, not all there. And it was not because my consciousness was still back in that virtual elsewhere in cyberspace where it had just been bumping clumsily (textually) into the other attendees’ projections.”
Through advancements in representational technology, we no longer bump into each other only textually. These interactions are made visible by avatar bodies, which, like the astronaut’s suit, allow for navigation, translation, and support of the body in online space.

Changing Avatar perspectives
David Joselit, an art historian at Yale who has written extensively about representations of ourselves in technology, calls the avatar a “sentient cursor,” due to its function as a projection of agency and mobility in virtual space. While likening the avatar to a cursor for its interactive functions may be accurate, the avatar deserves to be elevated from the status of mere pointing tool.
The word "Avatar" comes from Sanskrit, and traditionally refers to a manifestation of Hindu deities or souls in bodily form. Avatars have been used in cyberculture to describe any representation of an embodied identity, from small static icons to three-dimensional, fully articulated bodies with seemingly autonomous animated breathing, walking, and talking styles.
While it is possible for multiple people to control a single avatar, the avatar represents a single identity with what new media theorist Jay David Bolter calls “identificatory mobility,” which enables the avatar to “inhabit the point of view of any person, animal, or object.”
The converse is also true, and extremely common: one person often controls multiple different avatars.
Switch perspectives: are you your Avatar?
The perspective from which avatars are operated has been broken down into a five point system of action/identification/subject positioning by Mary Flanagan in her analysis of Tomb Raider’s Lara Croft.
Croft’s body – created by the media consumptive habits of the predominant demographic of video game players (namely teenage boys) – is not only notoriously over-sexualized, but it often forces its typically male players to identify with a female-bodied character.
Here are the five perspectives she identified:

The first perspective Flanagan describes is the omniscient perspective: from which they control the character’s actions and observe the world, unlimited by the perspective of the avatar.
The second perspective is described when the character acts independently: breathing or performing other automatic animations out of the user’s control.
The third perspective is the second-person perspective: in which users feel as if they are acting next to the character, co-adventuring alongside her.
The fourth perspective is of players taking the position of spectator, in which they relinquish control of the character and do not experience her world firsthand: taking a third-person position as though watching a film.
The fifth and final perspective is when players act through the character and identify themselves as the avatar.


Avatars and "gender-bending"
Gender remains a hot topic in the male-dominated environs of online gaming – where avatars are ubiquitous – as there is a statistically high possibility that the operator of a female avatar is, in fact, biologically male.
Nick Yee, a researcher of gamers’ behaviors for Ubisoft, created The Daedalus Project, a long-running survey of massive multiplayer online gamers, which analyzed many facets of play such as demographics, motivations, relationship formation, and “gender-bending.”
According to his demographic analyses, 85% of players are male, and male players are three to five times more likely to play as a character of the opposite gender. As a result, he concludes, there is an approximately 50% chance that any female character encountered in the game is being operated by a male player.
Yee offers a number of explanations for this behavior, claiming a pragmatic advantage: female avatars receive more offers for help and companionship. The social stratification of women as weaker and less capable than men bleeds into the world of online games, but is considered an advantage of playing a female character, not a degradation of women in general.
There is a pragmatic consideration for men playing female avatars: if they are going to devote hours – even years –  of their lives to these games, they may prefer the scopophilic perspective. He calls this “Lara Croft Syndrome” (there she is again!) “ - the appeal of being able to view and, more importantly, control a female body that is sexy but deadly.”
He argues that this is a technique of domination, giving men the ability to control a powerful female body. But Flanagan’s analysis of the complicated perspectival relationship between avatars and their operators adds nuance to the narrative of men simply controlling female bodies, because of the necessity for users to identify with their characters in the first person, to accompany their characters from a second person perspective, and even to believe that the character is acting autonomously.
The bodies we choose
Tom Boellstorff, an anthropologist who was studying sexuality in Indonesia, simultaneously performed an ethnographic study within the virtual reality of Second Life by conducting fieldwork online using an avatar he called Tom Bukowski.
Second Life’s avatars are three- dimensional and very sophisticated – with a high degree of customizability, especially for those with programming skills. The freedom of self-representation allowed by these avatar bodies often tempts users to project an idealized version of themselves.
Tom Boellstorff’s avatar, Tom Bukowski, was a very similar looking, but slightly younger and more muscular version of himself. He retained his first name, his profession, and his glasses in his Second Life identity, but added tattoos and a hipster haircut to his avatar identity.

”Although an elephant, Rashi offers many possibilities for identity exploration for a man trying to bring together his artistic and managerial talents.”

But not all users project an idealized, younger, or more conventionally attractive version of themselves. Sherry Turkle, who also inhabited an avatar in order to conduct a study on the cybersocial space of Second Life, describes a talented programmer named Joel, who became known on Second Life as an artist for his proficiency at building and programming virtual architecture:
“While many in Second Life build an avatar that is sexy, chic, and buff - a physical embodiment of a certain kind of ideal self - Joel goes in a different direction. He builds a fantasy version of how he sees himself, warts and all.
“He makes his avatar a pint-sized elephant named Rashi, a mix of floppy-eared sweetness and down-to-earth practicality. On Second Life, Rashi has a winsome side but is respected as an artist and programmer. That is, Joel creates beautiful buildings and virtual sculptures by programming at his keyboard; his avatar Rashi gets the credit in Second Life.
“More than being an artist, Joel (as Rashi) also takes charge of things. He organizes virtual building projects and gallery installations. Rashi is the kind of manager Joel wants to be: strict but always calm and nonthreatening. Although an elephant, Rashi offers many possibilities for identity exploration for a man trying to bring together his artistic and managerial talents.”
The Avatar in VR: identity-tourism and white privilege
The identificatory mobility provided by virtual reality, to use Bolter’s term again, allows users to take subject positions wildly divergent from their daily experience, to change species, race, and gender, and perform in ways that would be physically impossible or inconceivably difficult offline. Turkle is one of the more optimistic researchers of identity development and performance in cyberspace.
Many other writers are significantly less optimistic about this. Even Chris Hables Gray who was quoted earlier expounding the sublime feelings elicited by his cyborgization, later quotes Sandy Stone, who points out: “No refigured virtual body, no matter how beautiful, will slow the death of a cyberpunk with AIDS.”
Many feminist writers like Stone have pointed out that the ability to alter one’s identity is most appealing to those who are already in a position of power, namely technologically literate white males, who can afford to masquerade as “Other,” for a short time before retreating to their privileged position. This argument reveals the ways that social privilege is transferred to cyberspace, notably in the performance of race and gender.
Lisa Nakamura, writing on the digitization of race, indicts those who engage in “race play”:
“Rather than ‘honoring diversity,’ their performances online used race and gender as amusing prostheses that could be donned and shed without ‘real-life’ consequences. Like tourists who become convinced that their travels have shown them real ‘native’ life, these identity tourists often took their virtual experiences as other-gendered and other-raced avatars as a kind of lived truth.”
Nakamura cites the prevalence of white male users embodying “exotic samurai and horny geishas” as perpetuating harmful stereotypes of Asians.
Tom Boellstorff admits that Second Life has some problematic policies regarding racialization of avatars’ skin tone, facial and other body features, and hair. Specifically, “That Second Life’s default embodiment was white reflected how ‘the power value of whiteness resides above all in its instabilities and apparent neutrality’... Many residents who designed skins for sale worked to create a range of skin tones, but white or near-white skins predominated and persons seeking darker skins complained of the difficulty in finding them.
Some residents who tried wearing nonwhite skins reported racist responses, including friends who stopped answering ims and statements that nonwhite persons were invading Second Life.”
Boellstorff also mentions communities that work actively to diversify Second Life and the censorship of racist speech by Linden Labs.

Avatars: setting us free from the drab limitations of our bodies

In an online gender-bending scenario, it may come as a shock to the man playing a female avatar to be barraged with sexually harassing messages from his peers.

Both Stone’s aging cyberpunk and performers of other genders and races use technology to have experiences that their physical embodiment will not allow.
In the most utopian post-identity discourses, avatarization can allow users to feel empathy for, even if they are not accurately replicating, the experience of others. Nakamura makes the point multiple times that online, users do not face discrimination that disadvantages them due to their actual bodies. She implores us to remember many people have more pressing issues to deal with in their real bodies:
“In the end, despite academic and commercial postidentitarian discourses, it does come down to [real] bodies: bodies with or without access to the Internet, telecommunications, and computers, and the cultural capital necessary to use them”
However, in an online gender-bending scenario, it may come as a shock to the man playing a female avatar to be barraged with sexually harassing messages from his peers, leading to a deeper – though still superficial – understanding of women’s experience.
The same could be said for those who wish to portray themselves as other races experiencing discrimination, or being called out by other users as perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
In the most optimistic scenarios, these situations raise awareness of social issues in those who, due to their privilege, may have been blind to them otherwise.

MONTAG magazine was launched by Grover – the easy-to-use flexible subscription platform for the latest tech products - to explore where new technology is taking us. With Grover, you can take home new technology without having to pay the full retail price – so read about the future and then check out what's available right now...

In MONTAG's Today’s Dystopia series, our writers explore the dystopian worlds of classic fiction, and see if our world has slipped closer to the fictional one since it was published. Is our cool new technology bringing us closer to a future we’re afraid of - or is it already here?

In MONTAG's third look at yesterday’s tomorrow’s dystopias today, we take a trip to what initially seems to be an utterly remote future with few parallels to our own.
Yet is the world that Ray Bradbury describes in Fahrenheit 451 – a controlling, authoritarian horror-show, occupied by puppet-humans for whom individual thought is, erm, unthinkable – actually so different to 2017? The technology we have today - VR headsets, social media, drones – all have clear parallels to technology that, in the book is used to shape a terrible future.
Upon publication in 1953, the New York Times described Fahrenheit 451’s vision of a near future as “frightening… an insane world, which bears many alarming resemblances to our own.” And that was in 1953, when the world was still slowly rebuilding itself from the devastating horror and stupidity of the Second World War.

![](/content/images/2017/06/Fahrenheit-451-original-cover.jpeg)

*The original cover of Fahrenheit 451, via bookriot.com*
Fahrenheit 451 is also a shockingly slim book. It takes just over a hundred pages to fully describe both a brutally dictatorial world and the terrifyingly perverse logic that keeps its occupants in line, unquestioning, and removed from information that could change their world view.
Feasibly, you could read it in between breakfast and lunch and still have time to walk the dog and ponder whether, on reflection, it’s all still worth it.

Fahrenheit 451 is, famously, the temperature at which books burn.
The book's hero, Montag, is a fireman. Stirring stuff: except in this reality, a fireman's job involves rushing out to the homes of people who have been secretly hoarding books, and burning them down.
While fire is humanity’s oldest technology, the book also describes a coherent set of “future” tech which ensures docility and unwavering support for an invisible regime.
And seeing as much of the the book’s plausibility comes from the brutal effectiveness of technology, has 60-odd years of technological development brought us to a point where we can recognise the “future” in the present?
We’ve identified key themes of Fahrenheit 451 and marked how similar our world is to it. Spoilers ahoy, naturally - but then, if these "fictional" things have already happened, can they really be classed as spoilers?

Self-elective shielding from information - 3 firemen out of 5
The people in Fahrenheit 451 choose to keep away from books - partly through fear, partly though education (they are convinced that the content of books is an idiotic waste of time and space) and partly because they are absorbing so much easy pleasure from an array of technology.
Books have not suffered the same fate in our world - in 2016, 674 million new books were sold in the USA alone.
But just as the people in the book are not truly aware of the reasoning behind their disavowing of information that challenges their world view, today, we may not realise how carefully shielded we are online from views that challenge our own. Most of us now live in a bubble.

VR is not only a platform to play an endless succession of spooky space-based games or a more-immersive Minecraft - it’s threatening to revolutionise how we experience creative media altogether. (Try VR for yourself - rent Oculus or HTC Vive from Grover now!)
As well as allowing new artistic approaches, we can start digging into old art too, the spatial and temporal looseness of VR allowing us to slip through art’s traditional boundaries. Suddenly we can begin to prod, traverse and manipulate artwork that has been stranded in galleries and behind glass for hundreds of years. But if we start to fiddle with existing art, are we democratising access to it, or lessening its impact?

The changes that VR will bring to the art world are the sweeping, all-encompassing kinds of change that happen every few hundred years. Grand shifts in the past have involved the discovery and implementation of forced perspective, the use of camera obscura lenses to more accurately depict the human figure, and the reality-shunning shift of Cubism.
And the effects of VR may not be simply experiential or creative: they may well revolutionise what the artist-viewer relationship is, and might - whisper it - reduce the monetary value of art as we know it to almost nothing.
Let’s look at three different ways that existing artists are using VR. It’s instructive to consider artists who have grown up and learnt “art” in a  pre-VR (Pre-R?) environment, rather than artists who have readily adopted VR technologies as they developed their creative sense. Why? Because  then we can see the changing of the guard, and how this changed is negotiated. The liminal periods are always the most exciting.

“One of the things I noticed with VR is a tremendous sense of centre… Knowing that I am within a space and understanding the parameters around me. I have also noticed that one’s affirmation of existence is always missing. You look down at your feet and there’s nothing there, so there’s a lot to be said about defining your own presence.” - Jeff Koons, Dazed

Both the physicality and concept of Jeff Koons’ art is welded to the trashiness of modern consumerism. His art is a deliberate conundrum: grotesque and fun, silly and serious, lightweight and astonishingly expensive.
Jeff’s interest in VR arose via his collaboration with a new VR-Art experience, Acute Art. His commentary on VR in relation to art is telling: this is something that anyone playing a first-person-shooter video game has experienced too. Could it be that the art-world elder-statespersons are a bit… behind the times?



Well, maybe, but this gap also feels a little gauche, and his initial collaboration feels like a very 1.0 iteration of a bigger work. Jeff has been rattling the cage of our reality for a long time: his giant chrome dog-balloons feel like they have been tipped out of a virtual world into our own.
There’s no denying that for Marina Abramovic’s work, Virtual Reality makes sense, albeit in a different way. Her work has continually explored human connection, intimacy, and the uncomfortable clarity that accompanies truly looking someone in the eye.



For those who queued for hours (or days) at Abramovic’s MoMA retrospective, The Artist Is Present, where Abramovic sat in situ for 750 hours, and allowed anyone who waited long enough to gaze deep into her eyes, VR may be a line-skipping treat.
Klaus Biesenbach, MoMA curator believes that, “Marina is never not performing. The audience is fuel to her, in effect, a lover.” - which raises the question: does interacting with a virtual Marina, who can’t gaze back and bathe in your attention, even count?
VR undoubtedly allows at least a one-way version of intimacy. The scanned-and-digitised virtual-Marina responds to you and your actions - as if you were there, face-to-face. It’s just that, well, you’re not: VR can’t yet quite close the gap.
It’s undoubtably a start: but does embracing the technology necessarily undermine both Abramovic’s Modus Operandi and her je ne sais quoi?




Perhaps it’s existing pop-culture artists who are best able to pivot to the new medium. If VR allows big-name art to find a new audience, then it also democratises access. Pop music is about connectivity to the masses, so surely pop music — the most successful practitioners of which have taken complex new music and made it accessible to the many — should be best positioned to take advantage.
Inevitably it was Bjork, the endlessly restless artist-with-a-capital-“A” of the pop world who would pioneer in this virtual space. Her last few songs have been accompanied by increasingly complicated and boundary-poking videos: starting with an intimate 360 video, and most recently with a video that is part-performance, part-VR.



Bjork considers VR differently to Jeff Koons’ self-focussed observations. She sees it as a “private circus,”  that is also, “a theatre able to capture the emotional landscape of performance.”
Bjork has tailored her VR output to be in line with the accessible, exciting and democratising nature of new technology: it’s there for you to experience, you just need the gear to experience it.
At the moment, that VR gear is not common-or-garden enough for us to all be kicking back on the sofa with a tub of popcorn, ready get up-close-and-personal with our Icelandic art-pop hero. So right now your best opportunity to experience Bjork in true VR is at a series of retrospective exhibitions that offer a necessary halfway house between our democratised art-future and the ages-old mechanic of queuing and paying for access.
Maybe for us to make a real leap into the future of an art-existence where “value” becomes about the experience and not the price tag, and “art” becomes fluid, sticky and malleable, we should embrace death, jumping back in time, and some true artistic license.

Questions around mortality and life itself are soon brought to the surface the moment you dip a toe into VR. If our computing power enables us to recreate anything in a pseudo-reality, then life itself becomes an easily surmountable barrier.
Salavdor Dalí’s work lends itself well to virtual investigation: after all, he created famously surreal work that encourage the viewer to imagine themselves wandering around inside them.
So, the thinking goes, why not actually recreate his paintings in VR, and then… explore them? This is what the Dali VR Experience allows you to do.
Salvador Dalí was extremely interested in science and technology and in the 1930s, found the discoveries of quantum physicists to be intellectually liberating, offering an opportunity to root his surreal ideas in reality. If physical models allowed for simultaneous realities, the idea went, then Dalí’s wildest dreams could be a remote possibility after all.
So it stands to reason that he may have embraced the reality-jolting and believability-blurring technology of VR. But would he approved of a team of VR artists playing fast and loose with one of his key works, his painting Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet’s “Angelus”?



Frankly, while the Dalí VR Experience takes the concept of “artistic licence” to its literal conclusion, the absence of preciousness around the Dalí brand and its crown jewels is impressive.
It’s a bold stance, but in line with his own curiosity. It seems inconceivable that an artist like Dalí, who freely played with form, structure, composition and physical possibility in his paintings, photographs and installations, would not embrace the chance to use VR to twist the concrete into something weird.

The fact that the execution of the VR is - while perhaps not as mind-boggling as the painting itself -  a smart extrapolation of the ideas into the technology, it means that it’s us, the art lovers, who actually expand our viewpoint and step into the mind of a genius.
And in a very important way, when artworks have become wrenched from their intended purpose - to entertain and intrigue the public - and gobbled up by capitalism, any technology that connects the public with art in a more democratic way is more valuable than any ludicrous price tag.

Seeking happiness amongst the world’s biggest #content dumpYoutube isn’t just the place that everyone goes to watch literally anything that can be uploaded and/or slip though their content copyright detection system. It’s also the world’s second biggest search engine in terms of the volume of searches and time spent searching, although of course, it only searches Youtube content, and not the wider web. Youtube processes over three billion searches a month, and while a large proportion of them are #teens simply finding the latest #content from Youtubers complaining at narcissistic length about how unfair it is that they are being demonetised, surely most people are simply searching for stuff that makes them happy.One of the more unfortunate quirks of Youtube is the way that the keywords that algorithms recognise have bled over into the titles of the video - resulting in the Youtube snake eating its own tail and people now produce low-grade, shock-filled videos for kids with content that is designed to fit the titles... which have been generated by an algorithm to attract the attention of viewers. Thus, children are now treated to videos with titles like "Bad Kids & Learn Colors Giant Watermelon Finger Family Song Nursery Rhymes | Learning Video For Kids.”  and we are slowly being programmed to search for things in ways that mimic how the algorithm thinks, and not the other way around.But if you wanted to find something that made you happy on Youtube, what happens when you simply started with than the word… “happy”? MONTAG wanted to know if some simple searches for happiness actually made us feel happier. So we typed in some basic happiness-seeking search terms, filtered the results by Play Count, and investigated further.Youtube Search Term: “Happy”NOTES: This is the simplest starting point. What is happier than “happy”?Results:Ranking: 1 - Pharrell Williams - Happy (Official Music Video) - 5Bn viewsOf course the utterly inescapable “Happy” tops this search term. It’s been played enough - a ludicrous five billion times - to suggest that people like playing it a lot and that these people feel happier as a result. The video is filled with people who genuinely look as if they are overflowing with joy as they dance along to a song that is essentially weaponised happiness. Pharrell, dressed at one point as a sort of Happiness Boy Scout, bludgeons the viewer into a pleasure coma with a melody and lyric so simple and so effective, it’s hard to believe there was a time when it did not exist. MONTAG was not immune and felt approximately 200% happier after watching this video - and it’s not even Pharrell’s best song, either.Ranking: 2 - Robin Thicke - Blurred Lines ft. T.I., Pharrell - 568M viewsAstonishingly, Pharrell features in the second-highest-viewed “Happy” video too, making him the World’s Happiest Man. Sadly, he features in a video with the World’s Sleaziest Man, Robin Thicke, in a video that reduces women to beautiful ornaments and thus is possibly The World’s Most Demeaning Video. It’s a good song, but all happiness is drained by Thicke’s presence. However, help is at hand: the song was legally proven to have been *extremely similar* to Got To Give lt Up by Marvin Gaye, which is a) a better song and b) guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.Ranking: 4 - Pharrell Williams - Happy (Official Music Video) -  414M viewsPharrell must have accidentally uploaded the video to ‘Happy” twice by mistake, and thus garnered another ½ Bn views on a different account. Bad SEO, but still a big glut o’ happy.Ranking: 8 - If You're Happy | Super Simple Songs - 324M viewsThis song and video manages to simplify the song "If You're Happy And You Know It” and claims to allow kids to “practice the emotions happy, angry, scared, and sleepy with this super fun song.” MONTAG wonders whether sleepiness is a legit emotion to include in this list when it could actually be an indicator of Thyroid disease, but there’s no doubt that this video represents a Happiness Dichotomy: while small children will take lots of happiness from repeatedly singing along to this video, their long-suffering parents will soon start to lose their minds.Ranking: 9 - Ed Sheeran - Happier (Official Video) - 268M viewsSTATUS UPDATE: MONTAG Happiness Levels report a sudden 200% drop and a simultaneous 250% increase in dreariness. Emergency action required.Ranking: 17 - Thomas Rhett - Die A Happy Man - 180M viewsOK, we’re done here.Youtube Search Term: “Make me happy”NOTES: These darn Millennials are such navel-gazers, they would surely DEMAND it from their default thought-leader, Youtube, right?Results:Ranking: 1 - Mariah Carey - All I Want For Christmas Is You - 539M viewsNothing to see here, move along please: this song and video are pure, uncut, happiness-inducing Xmas Fayre that has caused spontaneous singing, drinking, hugging and dancing at Christmas parties every December since 1994. It’s one of humanity’s greatest net happiness contributors, and is unimpeachable. Don’t even try to disagree.Ranking: 6 - You are my Sunshine - 31M viewsSurely, this is one of the most charming quirks of circumstance on Youtube. Back in 2008, Youtube user DjRoguefire uploaded folk singer Elizabeth Mitchell’s version of classic feel-good ditty You Are My Sunshine, and accompanied it with various stock images of sunsets and smily faces as a cheesy love-tribute to his girlfriend Erica. And then it somehow got played 31 million times. In 11 years, DjRoguefire has uploaded a total of five videos, and the second highest play count is, at 17,000 plays, not quite as popular.You Are My Sunshine is a song that has been covered by about a million artists since it was written in 1939, and is a classic feel-good song. Coupled with the cute backstory, this might be the Last Pure Happy Corner Of Youtube. Score: 10/10.Ranking 7 - Things That Make Me Happy - 27M viewsIs MONTAG immediately cynical about a video titled “Things That Make Me Happy”, complete with a thumbnail of someone pulling Youtube Face, uploaded by WASSABI (sic) Productions and featuring “humorous skits” performed by two self-obsessed baby-faced try-hards who equate “funny” with “making loud noises”?  Yes.Was MONTAG right to be cynical? Yes.Did it make us happy? *smash cut to wildly gurning 19-year-old’s face with “NO, LOL” written on it in Magic Marker*Ranking 19 - 99% CHANCE that these BABIES Will MAKE YOU LAUGH! - Funny KIDS videos - 9M viewsThankfully, content-scraping supremos BabiezTV has scoured the internet for all the #content that they don’t own the copyright to and successfully flood our eyeballs with totez adorbz content featuring toddlers doing loveably funny stuff, proving that even content aggregation farms can spark joy.Youtube Search Term: “Am am so happy”NOTES: Maybe we can find inspirational videos of people who are so happy that they simply had to share their unique moment of joy with the world!Results:Ranking: 1, 3, 4 and 8 - Pharrell Williams - Happy - billions and billions and billions of viewsChrist, Pharrell, give everyone else a chance, will you? Take the day off or something. Read a book.Ranking: 2 - Nirvana - “Lithium” - 157M viewsErm, right. I mean, fair enough, the first lyric in this song is “I’m so happy…” but it also refers to possibly killing the subject of the lyric. Lithium is used as a drug to treat people with Major Depressive Disorder. Plus, it’s Nirvana, who were not noted for their knock-about larks and jaunty happiness, despite grinning like loons in a surprising percentage of their photographs. Ranking: 14 - Brain Breaks - Action Songs for Children - Happy Dance - Kids Songs by The Learning Station - 4.7M viewsThis video features a bunch of grinning #teens dancing along with an extremely jovial older gentleman, and dancing a cheerful dance. MONTAG tried the dance moves out and can confirm that they do immediately induce a rush of happiness and rosy-cheeked giggling. It feels like our brains were somehow hacked by a kindly grandad. Recommended.Ranking: 15 - Reacting to MARBLE MACHINE COVERS - This made me so happy! - 4M viewsMONTAG is utterly conflicted. On one hand, we continue to love the Wintergaten marble machine. On the other, this is a *Reaction Video* - AKA the lowest form of video #content available in humanity’s most conniving toolbox. Yet, this is the only video that has fulfilled our aim of finding someone sharing their own happiness in a video. Martin, the hirsute Marble Machine guy, bobs his head and grins as he and we watch a bunch of people cover the song from his original Wintergaten video. Happiness is indeed infectious, but sometimes the net increase is in the fractions of a percentage. A very qualified success.Ranking: 18 - Sting - I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying - 2.3M viewsAnd lo, in one fell swoop, Sting, sporting the most completely ridiculous haircut in his long career of sporting ridiculous haircuts, destroys all the happiness we built up on our quest in one three-minute pop video in which he rides a shimmering silver horse through a small town and sings a song that is so M.O.R., it has a white stripe all the way along it. At one point Sting ascends to heaven, holding his arms out, Jesus-like, before returning to earth on his f*cking horse to interrupt a barn dance attended by a mixture of rednecks and bug-eyed alien Greys. When the song ended, Youtube autoplayed “Englishman in New York.” Everything is awful. MONTAG’s Learning: when it comes to happiness, Youtube giveth, and Youtube taketh away; and is aided and abetted by Sting.

If it turns out that music is really good for your health, could your healthcare plan pay for your Spotify subscription? It's actually more plausible than you might think: a series of scientific tests have shown that certain kinds of music can reduce the sensation of physical pain or help prevent addiction. Episode 15 of the MONTAGE, is not only about how music soothes the the savage beast, but how Twitter - yes, Twitter - has revolutionised how we experience literature - yes, literature - and not just by making it really, really short.

Wearables, once the hot tech du jour, are now part of our toolkit to make normal life a little bit better. Track and tweak your sleep to wake up feeling fresher. Use a fitness tracker to lose your wobbly bits. Try an Apple Watch to help remember to get up and walk around.
But what if your wearable was not something you wore on your skin, but under it? Kathryn Lawrence looks into a world of skin-deep wearables where it's hard to tell which tech is real and which is a hoax...





“When you’re on the crowded dance floor with those red hot saxophones,
Tain’t no sin to take off your skin and dance around in your bones”

Lee Morse, “Tain’t No Sin”
Most of us don’t think about “wearing” our skin, but our largest organ already does so much for us that we should consider it the original wearable technology (more OG than clothes!).
It heats and cools our bodies, protects all our innards, and houses a lot of our built-in sensors (aka the nervous system) that transmit information about our bodies and our environment. But it could do more.
Technological interventions like those covered in The Wild World of Human Augmentation have shown how much we can enhance our bodies by integrating them with technology.


"Project Underskin," via New Deal Design

Beautifully designed conceptual predictions like “Project Underskin” may show what skin-integrated technology might look like, but we want to explore tech that actually exists – and that’s harder to find than you would think, since there is so much vaporware in the wearable industry.

Hoaxes and Jokesters
There are a lot of too-cool-to-be-true products out there, and a lot of videos showing fake products with the help of computer-generated graphics. You have to know what to look for when watching these videos: too much contrast between the “screen” and the rest of the image, shrewd framing not fully showing the devices or only showing them from one angle, and other dead giveaways of bad video editing.
This video, for the Cicret Bracelet, went viral back in 2014:



Their website advertises it as “like a tablet… but on your skin” and the video features many images of people on the go using their forearms the same way we use the screen of a smartphone - browsing websites, playing mobile games, checking maps, and answering phone calls (when the phone is on the table literally less than two feet away…).
Using crowdfunding, Cicret raised over $500,000 to produce their product, but unfortunately what they are going to deliver couldn’t possibly live up to the promise of their campaign video. YouTuber <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbgvSi35n6o” target=”_blank”>Captain Disillusion has debunked many of the claims about the technology in the original video (such as their motion-sensing mechanism, or distortion from the display capabilities of a pico projector), and also pledged $250 of his own money to try to receive the Bracelet himself (which was projected to retail at $300).
After pushing their original “end of 2016” release date to mid-2017, the Cicret site has announced they are “ready to produce the Bracelet” and have “sourced all the components needed.” In their <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsMrsBMS-fc&” target=”_blank”>last working prototype video, posted five months ago as of this writing, they show a massive device compared to the original design and claim they are still “on track” to make it “much more smaller and design,” but popular opinion is that this product is never going to exist the way that they advertised it.
Even more well-designed, and courteously not trying to take anyone’s money, is <a href=”http://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/introducing-the-worlds-first-electronic-ink-tattoo?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=description%20link&utm_campaign=april1” target=”_blank”>“The World’s First E-Ink Tattoo” by Emergence Interactive. Announced on April 1, 2015, it claims to have e-ink technology (like in a Kindle) inserted under the skin, which is connected to a smartphone app that controls the display any image from the phone.
It’s a really good fake, and seems marketed towards people who are afraid of the permanence of tattooing, or want to see their Apple Watch displays projected on their arm.




The Real Deal
There are several products currently available that turn your skin into a wearable technology: but neither of them allow you to display information from your phone. The emerging skin-integrated technologies are more about using the skin as a sensor, sending data from gestures or from your biometric data.


 DuoSkin via MIT Media Lab

DuoSkin was produced by a collaboration between scientists at MIT and Microsoft. Inspired by the popular metallic silver and gold temporary tattoos now commonly seen at music festivals, these temporary skin-safe applications of gold leaf actually work as functioning circuits.
The DuoSkin fabrication process allows anyone to make their own wearable circuits, if they can program them and get access to the necessary materials. First, you have to design the circuit and print it onto vinyl. Then apply gold leaf on top of the circuit apply it as you would any temporary tattoo before mounting the electronic components like tiny NFC chips with skin-friendly adhesives.
In their proofs of concept, they made DuoSkin interfaces that were able to control mobile devices, display and store information on the skin. The flexibility and DIY-ableness of DuoSkin was an intentional goal of the DuoSkin development team:
“We believe that in the future, on-skin electronics will no longer be black-boxed and mystified; instead, they will converge towards the user friendliness, extensibility, and aesthetics of body decorations, forming a DuoSkin integrated to the extent that it has seemingly disappeared.”



The biometric sensors of Rotext look only slightly less flashy, but have just as many practical applications, among them VR and AR, remote controls, healthcare, fitness, and fashion. In a video posted in December of 2016 they show their electronic tattoo technology made of biometric sensors that are “as thin as hair, and light as a feather” being used in a multitude of ways:



The video is so advanced and shows so many diverse uses for the device that it’s hard to believe they have made a real product that is capable of all of these things, but they did show their technology at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show and say it will be available for approximately $300 in mid-2017.
In <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT7sCMY9NE” target=”_blank”>a video from CES 2017, a woman being interviewed at their booth while wearing one of their adhesive arrays of sensors, explains that currently the skin interface can’t work on its own – you have to carry a small plastic box about the size and shape of a domino which houses Bluetooth and a rechargeable battery. It’s not clear whether the box has to touch the skin to get the data or whether it can communicate with the skin sensor from your pocket.




Skin Deep
We already don’t think twice about transdermal medical devices like pain relievers or nicotine patches, so it makes sense that stickable, peelable electronics could catch on, and the theories of how they actually work - and materials that these technologies could be made of - have already been proven.
Many of the skin-interface technologies currently in development actually come from making skin for robots, which has to be sensitive to all of the things human skin is, but also interface with a computer system to process that data.
The question isn’t when we will have this technology, but how we can improve it and make it easier to manufacture as well as more usable and ecologically friendly.
The leading lab for research in “e-skin” technologies is from the University of Tokyo, which released a paper in Frontline Technology about Imperceptible Electronic Skin to “describe recent progress, bottlenecks, and future applications for extra-light and flexible interfaces such as electronic skin.”
One of the recent challenges is making thin-film transistors (or TFTs) that can hold up to the same conditions as skin: flexibility, durability, and density are all problems.
“TFTs do not just allow the electronics to be flexible – they can also help E-Skin mimic the sensitivity of real human skin.  There are more than 2 million pain receptors and 30,000 thermal receptors in a person’s entire skin, which is equivalent to the number of pixels found in a typical high-definition television.  A major obstacle for E-Skin is figuring out how this many sensors can be integrated into electronic sheets.  Two-million sensors cannot be directly wired up to the driver circuits that control them because this would require cramming 2-million contact pads onto a silicon chip.  (Of course, it will not usually be necessary to create a piece of E-Skin this large.)”
While it may not be necessary to make human-sized e-skins, it’s very cool to imagine the uses for a full-body computer: VR-responsive controllers that slip on like Morphsuits, or interpretive dances created in collaboration with neural networks.
And the future holds even more intriguing possibilities. “Green” or  biodegradable electronics are also currently in development. So, in the future, you could wear all the contents of your smartphone right on your arm, and shed your e-skin like a snake when it’s time for an upgrade. How about that for wearable?

Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism is a meme – it's a joke, but it's also a dream. It's leftist futurism taken to the extreme. But would you prefer to envision a future of mostly manual labor, poverty, compulsory heterosexuality, and super-late capitalism on boring old Earth? I think not!
Consider this article as a launch pad and a full tank of ideological powdered aluminum to rocket your mind into a radical future – radical in the sense of favoring drastic political, economic, and social reforms, but also radical as in totally flipping sweet.
Come on and slam, and welcome to the jam


*Original poster by NASA JPL, text added by the internet*

"Fully Automated Luxury Communism," (we'll get to the gay space parts in a bit) entered the internet's lexicon thanks to one Aaron Bastani, a British political commentator who discussed the idea with The Guardian in March of 2015. In the article, he joins an ever-increasing group of people worrying about what will happen to society as automation replaces jobs, but proposes a rosy solution: "the only utopian demand can be for the full automation of everything and common ownership of that which is automated... a 10- or 12-hour working week, a guaranteed social wage, universally guaranteed housing, education, healthcare and so on."
Bastani isn't the first to suggest a universal basic income as an answer to automation – this short infographic from Futurism.com explains which countries and industries are predicted to feel the effects of job loss due to automation most acutely, alongside some experiments in universal basic income conducted in 2016 in Kenya, Finland, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. And the concept of UBI has been steadily picking up steam in the last couple of years, particularly among the tech elite who are ushering in the age of robots. Even famed champion of workers (sarcasm) Elon Musk publicly voiced his support for universal basic income.
But a period of UBI-enabled socialism is only the gateway to Fully Automated Luxury Communism, because the end result should be a redistribution not only of wealth, but of all the resources of our planet – before we turn to seizing the resources of the rest of the cosmos. This assumes a complete restructuring of society and the economy as we know it under capitalism and the prerequisite of a post-scarcity economy.
In a paper presented to the World Future Society conference in 2009, Stephen Aguilar-Milan, the director of research for the European Futures Observatory, claimed that we could be living in a post-scarcity economy as soon as 2050-2075. Aguilar-Milan and his team posit that the current age of scarcity (the condition of a majority of global citizens not having access to the basic resources required to live, much less thrive), due to the inequalities fundamental to the structure of global capitalism, will reach a point that most other economic theorists call "Peak Oil," but which they term "Peak Just About Everything" between 2015 and 2040. This period of economic turmoil is the catalyst they see being able to upset the entrenched systems of global capitalism and encourage a radical redistribution of resources.
Of course, with the introduction of fracking and other alternative methods of natural resource extraction, peak oil hasn't quite arrived the way we expected it; but the acceleration of the effects of climate change due to these new extraction technologies are positioned to serve as a catalyst just as well.
Way back in 1858, a little guy you may have heard of called Karl Marx also predicted that automation would usher in the post-capitalist era. In a section of the Grundrisse known as the "Fragment on Machines," he lays out that since capitalism relies on the surplus of labor and accelerates technology to accomplish this labor, it will eventually create the conditions of its own undoing: labor time will be reduced to almost nothing, and workers will be free to develop themselves as individuals.
Think of Amazon reinvesting its revenue for the last 20 years and Jeff Bezos now standing at the head of a global empire of algorithmically-directed warehouses chock full of robots. When it's no longer a requirement that Amazon's warehouses require humans to operate under inhumane conditions, and let's say Amazon takes over the world and automates humans out of work for every industry, what will the workers of the world do with all of their time?
Seize the memes of production



Here we are at Fully Automated Luxury Communism, and now the fun stuff can happen (the gay stuff, in space).
One reason the internet loves FALGSC is purely for the aesthetic: Soviet-era images of what communist life in space would look like still tickle the imagination, and the memeification of political ideologies and historial events is relentless. If you don't believe me, consider an offering from College Humor entitled "Seize the Means of Production With These 18 Communist Memes" or this explainer from Broadly about "How Meme Culture Is Getting Teens Into Marxism". And although both articles were published nearly a year ago, the memery at /r/fullcommunism continues unabated, and the real edgelords on the internet now primarily joke about endorsing Posadism.
Ironically professing love of communism for the aesthetic has likely reached its peak in the inevitable wave-postfixed music genre L A B O R W A V E, a spinoff of Vaporwave's slowed-down 80s pop music that overlays Soviet Era propaganda.



Space travel is taken as an inevitable outcome of FALC, but where does the "gay" part come in? All of the thinkers proposing UBI or full communism inevitably have to wonder what people will do if they're no longer subjected to labor, and they come to similar conclusions.
Elon Musk said, "People will have time to do other things and more complex things, more interesting things," and Karl Marx called it, "The free development of individualities." Although some would like to substitute "queer" for "gay" in FALGSC to be more inclusive, it isn't meant to literally mean compulsory homosexuality, but that in a freer futuristic society, categories like gender will become completely meaningless because people will be able to do whatever they want.
And the internet has concluded that means doing more gay stuff in space, which brings a whole new meaning to the illustration from The Jetsons used in the Guardian article that started it all: Jane Jetson and Rosie enjoying an afternoon of watching television while other machines tend to Jane's hair and nails and a drone bearing snacks hovers nearby.
A future without work where you can also have a fulfilling lesbian relationship with your robot maid: Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism today.

• Sell Yourself! Part Two
• Ray Against The Machine: Transhumanism’s savant-prince has called time on humanity

New tech isn't just lighter, faster wearables or drones - food has been re-engineered with the same ruthless approach. You can survive solely on Soylent, the meal replacement wonder-powder that has taken Silicon Valley by storm. But would you want to? And what would it say about you if you did?

Soylent was designed for efficiency, for body hackers who want to spend their twenty waking hours hacking industries and building empires – because if you sleep more than four, you’re not disrupting enough. Rob Rhinehart, CEO and founder of Rosa Labs, which has been distributing Soylent commercially since 2014, explained his relationship with food this way: “I utilize soylent only at home and go out to eat when craving company or flavor.”
Many have criticized Soylent and Rhinehart’s attempt at engineering a more perfect fuel for the human machine with his highly nutritious synthetic food substitute, as antisocial, unhealthy, and restrictive. As someone who was once a subscriber to Soylent 2.0, I can defend its nutritional validity as a meal replacement, but concede that it’s also one of the loneliest things you can eat.

Once a month, a cube of matte white bottles with black tops filled with 400 calories of liquid Soylent each was delivered to my door in San Francisco.



Soylent box and bottle via Soylent

Once a month, a cube of matte white bottles with black tops filled with 400 calories of liquid Soylent each was delivered to my door in San Francisco. At the time I lived with a software engineer who was also devoted to the Soylent lifestyle (and quite possibly still is) during what I believe historians will call the city’s second (or third, or hundredth) gold rush.
Everyone we knew was in a startup or tech company, and building their own company or app on the side; everyone was trying to eke out a few more hours every day to work on their personal projects that would propel them to Zuckerberg levels of success, or hustle at a second job, because even in 2014 the cost of living was astronomical. We were both in that grind-or-die mindset: cutting corners on time and money any way we could.
The original formulation of Soylent was a powder which was to be mixed with water and oil to form a shake that you were supposed to carry around in a BPA-free thermos all day. Our household decided nobody had time for that (efficiency = king!) and started ordering after Soylent 2.0 was released.

In what’s either fantastic marketing targeted directly at us Silicon Valley tech nerds, or simply Rhinehart’s robotic way of seeing the world, iterations of the Soylent recipe are numbered like software updates

In what’s either fantastic marketing targeted directly at us Silicon Valley tech nerds, or simply Rhinehart’s robotic way of seeing the world, iterations of the Soylent recipe are numbered like software updates, including release notes and a changelog of the nutritional tweaks for each iteration. 2.0 was the first version to be packaged as a liquid, pre-mixed.
Various media outlets tried the “I ate only Soylent for thirty days” stunt, derived from Rhinehart’s claims that he lived on it exclusively for as long before releasing the first version of the formula to the public. As far as we know now, in 2016, Soylent is nutritionally stable. Can our bodies reliably absorb all these synthetic nutrients and vitamins suspended in algal gloop? It seems like yes, but only more time will tell.



There are people who have lived on it, or used it as a meal replacement consistently, for years at this point, with no obvious repercussions. This isn’t to say it’s perfect, or even safe: Rosa Labs’ latest product, Soylent Food Bars, were recalled in October of 2015 for making several consumers violently ill and have yet to be re-released. (In my personal experience, however, 2.0’s product quality was very reliable.)
The digestibility was one of the most talked-about features of a Soylent diet in the media: some people had terrible, noxious flatulence. I have a pretty sensitive stomach and after the first time that I felt like vomiting after chugging a bottle (I later learned to grab a straw and sip at it instead of downing it all at once, because the body is not equipped for absorbing 400 calories of complete nutrition at the same time) I did not have any gastrointestinal issues. Without getting too gross, my digestion was optimal.

Products labeled as “liquid diets” and “meal replacements” are fraught with social baggage that usually associates them with women


via GIPHY

Products labeled as “liquid diets” and “meal replacements” are fraught with social baggage that usually associates them with women, and with foods that are designed to change the composition of your body. The Soylent brand has faced criticism saying it’s no different from what women have been drinking instead of eating for decades, but because it’s “now made by and for men, so we call it tech.”
What makes Soylent different from its meal replacement counterparts marketed towards women, however, is that Soylent is not designed to change the composition of your body. This is where the feminist outrage should be directed, towards a market that believes women don’t need or want complete nutrition, that we will accept insufficient amounts of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, or sugars because it will make us look good. Losing or gaining weight by drinking Soylent instead of eating real food is not the goal – the goal is simply to maintain your body with as little thought as possible. Of course, removing all the thought from food also removes all the emotion.

The goal is simply to maintain your body with as little thought as possible

The taste is not optimal. Some describe it as unoffensive but bland, like corn flakes or unsweetened soy milk. I thought 2.0 tasted like something unmentionable, but less salty, and totally repulsive. I learned from /r/soylent, the subreddit for Soylent users, what mixed well for flavoring, and found I could use two pumps of caramel coffee flavoring syrup to make it drinkable.
The community around Soylent discuss mixing it, hacking the formula, and ask each other nutritional or allergy-related questions, but to an outsider, their communications often read as bizarre and sad.
Thread titles like “Has anyone else noticed a shift from ‘Cheerio Milk’ to ‘Water filtered through a bunch of dirty cardboard’?” “Does food ever stop smelling amazing?” and “Do people worry about you?” reveal that although a supportive Soylent-eating community exists, they are still very separate from society, and suffer from the lack of pleasure from food, the lack of social contact, and whatever professional or personal goal is driving them to cut enjoyment of food out of their lives, which may not be worth the trade off.


Soylent pour via Futurism

The dream of Silicon Valley’s tech workers is that they’ll work so hard now, in the right place and at the right time, that they’ll never have to work again. For now, forego food and social interaction, forget about work-life balance, because once you sell your app or your company, you can live on the beach or travel all over the world and pursue your real passions (which probably include eating real food).
Tim Ferriss is a classic example: he claims in The Four-Hour Workweek that anyone can build their own company in their free time that will allow them to leave their office job and live an experimental lifestyle. After building a supplement company and releasing his book, he’s built a personal brand around life- and body-hacking for peak performance, but even he doesn’t endorse Soylent. His blog features a guest post titled “Soylent: What Happened When I Stopped Eating For Two Weeks,” where Shane Snow, not Tim Ferriss, tried living on it for only 15 days.

Because the bottom line is, working that hard sucks and very few will strike gold in Silicon Valley: over 1.3 million copies of The Four Hour Work Week have been sold, and we do not have a million tech millionaires.

Because the bottom line is, working that hard sucks and very few will strike gold in Silicon Valley: over 1.3 million copies of The Four Hour Work Week have been sold, and we do not have a million tech millionaires. A journalist writing for aptly-named blog The Hustle, who admitted their blood tests confirmed that they were healthier after a 30-day Soylent diet, recalled a quote from a hospice nurse in a book called Regrets of Dying, who said “All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.”
And that has to be the final word for my Soylent experience: regret. When I think about the times I replaced my dinner with Soylent because I was working too hard on the personal projects that were supposed to propel me into a world of financial and personal freedom to stop and eat, I can see now that those were the most depressing meals I hope I will ever have.
Life is too short, and while there’s nothing wrong with working as hard as you can to achieve your goals, neglecting your own enjoyment of life in service of them to that extent is just sad.

Our relationship with the concept of ownership has changed dramatically: for instance, why endlessly buy and dispose of new iPhones when you could rent them instead? In this new sharing economy, we're happy to rent out our spare rooms, share our cars, and barter unwanted items.
But what about the last thing we "own" in the traditional sense: our bodies? Kathryn Lawrence puts a value on your arms, legs, and eye teeth...

Sell your body… not how you think
Some say you may be worth more dead than alive but that's a pretty bleak way to think about your future. To put it more precisely, your organs are worth much more monetarily outside of your body than in you.
Until we perfect the science of cloning and figure out the ethics of slaughtering your clone for spare parts, or simply grow organs in labs, we are going to have to do things the old-fashioned way: organ transplants from corpses or live donors.
But it’s not just organs being traded on the open or the black market; there are many, many parts of your body you can sell, several of which you can part with painlessly (and live!) ...and did you ever wonder who’s buying?
Your Personal Inventory
What would you give an arm and a leg for? While voluntary limb amputation isn’t very common (they’re pretty stubborn to re-install) there are a lot of things you can live without if you’re really strapped for cash.
First let’s go through the human products you throw away all the time - money down the drain in a literal way. Then we’ll get to the slightly more risky (and more profitable) items before we hit the big ticket items that may cost you your life to sell.
No Sweat
You can’t sell your sweat (that we know of) but selling these waste products are about as easy. And while you can buy tears for $500.00 per mL, Lee Biosolutions does not list how much they paid the “Single Human Donor.”


Via Wikimedia Commons

Donating blood saves lives, and can net you $120 per year if you donate every 56 days and get a $20 gift card every time. And plasma isn’t much more lucrative than blood: depending where you are, you can get paid $20-50.
As we learned from Sean’s biohacking exploration, there’s a legitimate medical use for your #1 biggest waste product (or should we say number 2?). All gross puns aside, you can make $40 per donation off of selling your scheiße to a stool bank called OpenBiome if you have the right cocktail of bacteria in your gut to participate in fecal transplants for people afflicted with C. difficile.
The most innocuous fluid, that famously sterile (it’s not, actually) golden stream, supposedly can bring in up to $200 per serving. According to the basics of supply and demand, one would think this prolific, nutritious (it’s not, actually - doctors now say you shouldn’t even drink it in the wilderness) liquid would be cheap, because it’s so plentiful.
But it’s the demand that matters: if you manage to break into the market to sell drug-free urine to people who can afford both lots of drugs and lots of clean piss, rumor has it it’s incredibly lucrative.
The most painless and lucrative disposable human product you can sell by far is hair. Virgin hair, as in never chemically styled or dyed, depending on its purity, length, and color, can go for $250-$3,000. HairSellon has a nifty online calculator to help you figure out how much your hair is worth: red hair in particular is more valuable than other colors.
Sex-specific Human Products
That other bank of bodily fluids (the sperm bank) seems like a much more profitable option for those who can produce sperm: between $35 and $100 per donation or up to $125. Becoming a sperm donor also requires a screening process, which sources say very few actually qualify for - but it won’t hurt to try.




Only the Breast, “a community for moms,” is the open market for breast milk. They provide information about breast milk donor screening, collecting, handling, and storing milk for sale, as well as shipping with or without dry ice. By the ounce, and depending on various factors such as special diets, human breast milk costs $0.90 - $2.00, but considering that the average baby needs 25-35 oz per day, those numbers could really add up. 
That’s also assuming that the Only the Breast buyers are intending to feed it to babies, but there was a trend in the last few years for adults to drink it (which the Journal for the Royal Society of Medicine advises against).
If you produce eggs and are between the ages of 21 and 34 you can apply to undergo a series of tests and, after a several-week process including injections of fertility drugs and hormally-induced ovulation for the maximum harvest, walk away with up to $14,000 depending on how many eggs are produced. This includes an $8,000 compensation for all the appointments and medications. You could gather quite a nest egg, providing one for someone else!
Working as a surrogate and carrying someone else’s baby to term in your own womb (more like a body rental than a sale) can also pay $39,000 - $52,000 “depending on factors including the type of pregnancy and the number of previous pregnancies (surrogate mother experience)” – but that is seriously a full-time job.
Placentas are also highly valued for both cosmetic and nutritional purposes. If you can keep yours (some hospitals do not let their parents take them home) and don’t want to eat it yourself (as one source mentions stir frying it with onions and another recommends powdering it and mixing with something like a Bloody Mary, consider selling it to someone who will make it into a hair mask.   This one is a little tricky (and illegal in many places) to sell, so most sources won’t cite a price.
Illegal (For Now) & Risky (But Bankable)


Stanley the Spleen by The Wooly Kraken on Etsy

Due to the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, it’s mostly illegal to sell organs and internal tissues (even with a willing, live donor). However, in a 2011 legal case a U.S. court ruled that bone marrow should no longer be included on that list. They also set the price at up to $3,000, but because it’s so hard to match bone marrow donors with those in need of marrow, it’s still very hard to get paid for a donation.
And finally, we’ve arrived at those bloody beans: your kidneys! Because of the aforementioned organ sale prohibition, it is definitely illegal to sell your own kidney in the US but somehow in 1999 someone managed to get bidding up to 5.7 million dollars for a kidney on eBay before they were delisted.
You didn’t hear it from me but after the organ harvesters and brokers take their cut, you can still get between one and ten thousand dollars a pop. Want more reliable (and legal!) compensation? Consider a holiday in Iran.
Do It Yourself

Theo the Thymus by The Wooly Kraken on Etsy

eBay’s policy on human remains and body parts states: “We don't allow humans, the human body, or any human body parts or products to be listed on eBay, with the exception of items containing human scalp hair.”
While another popular online marketplace, the handcraft and vintage shop Etsy, has a slightly looser animal products and human remains policy, prohibiting all items made from human remains, “except for teeth and hair.” It’s more likely you will find a crocheted organ like Theo the Thymus or Stanley the Spleen if your shopping proclivities include buying organs.
Scouring eBay for any human products that may have slipped through the cracks of this policy, we struck gold on a listing for a “Human soul great condition slightly used free of sin”. The seller notes that its quality is “weighted by several minor bad deeds, but all have been repented.” The price has been set at $500.00 with over 30 people watching the item at the time of writing, and yes, according to the description, they are extremely serious:


Human soul, jar not included by zlapatka on eBay


“A human soul extracted with the full consent of the previous owner. Any information regarding the previous owner is strictly confidential and may NEVER be revealed to the buyer or any third party.

The reason that speedrunners usually get media attention is for the hours and hours and days and days of time they spend playing the same game over and over to see who can complete it (to varying degrees) the fastest.
In contrast to traditional eSports, speedrunning has been called "the freestyle parkour of the medium - often free of reward, aimed at self-improvement, and aimed at breaking rules."

via GIPHY

If you've never heard of speedrunning video games, MakeUseOf has produced a detailed overview and claims speedrunning is the future of single player gaming.
Although its origins can be traced all the way back to early 90s games like DOOM, speedrunning has grown exponentially in recent years, thanks in part to the popularity of streaming on platforms like Twitch and marathon charity events like Games Done Quick, which have allowed strong community bonds to form over the grueling amount of practice required to achieve speedrunning notoriety.
Most observers find the dedication required, the commitment to creating muscle memory and the eye for detail down to single frames, to be the most interesting part, or they simply feed off of the frustration of speedrunners working towards their own personal bests and world records being thwarted mid-attempt and subsequently losing their shit.
But what could be the most fascinating aspect of speedrunning is not the "cosmic horror" of thousands of hours of human effort distilled into a single sublime performance when a record is broken – it's speedrunning's demonstration of the multiverse.
Breaking into multiverses
Theoretical physicist Brian Greene has been propagating the theory of the multiverse at least since 1999, in his book The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory, which was then turned into a three-hour television series by NOVA, explaining string theory, quantum mechanics, and other mysteries of physics for a broader audience.



In this scene (approximately 31 minutes through 34:30), Greene is illustrating that, according to the theories of quantum mechanics, anything is possible. Our normal laws of physics are possible, but so are (theoretically) every other subversion of those laws. Quantum calculations show that it is probabilistically possible for him to walk through a wall, but it would take an eternity of walking into the wall according to the laws of our universe's physics before he had a reasonable chance of succeeding in passing through. And in some alternate universe to ours, he does succeed.

via GIPHY

There are two parallels to speedrunning to be found here. The first involves breaking the laws of physics within the game world: finding places where walking through walls literally is more possible due to the game design, pushing past the boundaries of the visible space, and taking advantage of fluctuations in physical mechanics to disrupt the normal flow of time.
Finding these glitches in the universe is essential to all but "glitchless" speed runs, which are their own category, as are Tool-Assisted Runs, where players get godlike powers using emulators which enable them to manipulate the game at a level not humanly possible.
This anonymously-pasted text about "The Five Levels of Speedrunning," is meant to dissuade anyone interested in speedrunning by implying that the "god run" – that is, the world record breaking completion of a game in the quickest possible time, without any human errors – is impossible to achieve.

via GIPHY

Darbian, who until February of 2018, held the world record for speedrunning Super Mario Brothers, was recently beaten by a player called Kosmic by 66 milliseconds (approximately 4 frames of difference), and has said something similar about the "perfect" run of 4 minutes and 55 seconds: it would take "tens of thousands (or more) attempts needed to even get the chance at saving that time."
But this is the second way that speedrunning interacts with multiverse theory. In addition to breaking the mechanics inside of the game, speedrunners are also attempting to bring into being probabilistically impossible universes in the real world as well, through sheer repetition.
Kosmic estimated he attempted as many as 40,000 speedruns since 2011 to beat Darbian's record. To the community of dedicated gamers that make these attempts for hours every day on Twitch and YouTube, tens of thousands of attempts are not impossible.
Even games that are about bending the normal laws of physics like Portal are broken back into shape – the current record for a completion of the game without walking through a single portal is 47 minutes and 51 seconds, set by icy after playing the game for 1300 hours. In the first seven minutes, they get through part of the game that they expected to take the better part of an hour to complete.
(Icy tends to say "fuck my ass" as a mantra of concentration, and is relying on meme music to get in the zone while performing this feat, so headphones are recommended):



Without knowing anything about the prop mechanics, it's quite hilarious that when the player has a gun that shoots travel-through-walls beams, they are choosing instead to run at a single corner of the room holding a radio repeatedly.
Bludgeoning the wall with the radio does work, however, and allows them to juke through the void of non-space behind the walls of the level to end up at the starting place for the next sequence, walking backwards into the corner of a particular door frame to be launched above the normal playable area and skip through several rooms.
The thing about games is they have rules, and while the rules may be nonsense to begin with, their structure allows for the freedom of developing new strategies within and against them. The thrill of victory comes not only when you win by following them, but when you can win despite breaking rules that other people don't even know can be broken.
There are specific strategies that can be used to exploit randomness in games, called RNG manipulations (RNG = random number generator) which help speedrunners save time by knowing where certain items or enemies will be, or perform other calculations behind the scenes that influence the game's behavior. In part, speedrunning is a science, through which players are discovering the rules for making what seems random predictable.
It's also the definition of insanity: repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. But the results don't lie, and out of hundreds of hours of trying, whether by luck, skill, or quantum mechanics, they do find ways to pass through the walls of the game universe, and thousands of playthroughs in the real world manifest record times that skirt the impossible.

Simulated butterflies

via GIPHY

Daoist philosopher Zhuang Zhou may have been the first to propose the simulation hypothesis, when he remarked that upon awakening from a dream that he was a carefree and beautiful butterfly, he could no longer be certain that in his "real" life, he was not a butterfly dreaming that he was a man.
In the past few years, Silicon Valley’s billionaires have been waking up from their own butterfly dreams, including Elon Musk, who made the now-infamous statement in June 2016 on the stage of the Recode Conference that he believes the odds that we are in "base reality," that is, not living in a computer simulation, is "one in billions," based on the following logic:
"Forty years ago, we had Pong: like two rectangles and a dot. That was what games were. Now, forty years later, we have photorealistic 3-D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously, and it’s getting better every year. And soon we’ll have virtual reality, augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality."



This argument is loosely based on the one laid out in "Are You Living in a Simulation?" by Nick Bostrom, the philosophical thinker who also brought us the "paperclip maximizer" thought experiment of artificial intelligence and proponent of the Doomsday Argument. Bostrom suggests that the reason for a post-human civilization to create a simulation sufficiently advanced that we wouldn’t even know we were in it (referred to as an "ancestor simulation" in the original paper), is not at all clear:
"Maybe the scientific value of ancestor-simulations to a posthuman civilization is negligible (which is not too implausible given its unfathomable intellectual superiority), and maybe posthumans regard recreational activities as merely a very inefficient way of getting pleasure – which can be obtained much more cheaply by direct stimulation of the brain’s reward centers."
But Neil DeGrasse Tyson, who also professed support for the simulation theory in 2016 during the Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate, was also under the impression that our reality could be a simple game or diversion for these technologically advanced descendants of humanity: "It is easy for me to imagine that everything in our lives is just the creation of some other entity for their entertainment."
Bostrom concludes that unless we are living in a simulation right now, it is almost certain that our descendants will never create one, but as Musk points out, humanity has repeatedly expressed the desire to create games that are indistinguishable from reality: and we’re not only talking about verisimulators, we’re talking the whole existence enchilada.
There are already a couple of world-scale games that prove we can and most likely will (and therefore already have) created the simulation.
Everything
Physicists, cosmologists, and coders working across the world have recently accomplished computer simulations of the universe including galaxies, stars, supernovas, and black holes:



The closest thing to this that you can actually play is Everything. Everything, the game, lets you control a universe of things on the scale from bacteria to entire galaxies. Individually selecting and forming groups of objects, Everything lets you explore and experience animals, plants, humans, objects, every conceivable thing, set to hours of ambient original soundtrack and narrated by the British philosopher Alan Watts’ musings on changing your perspective and regarding the interconnectedness of the universe.



The game’s creator, artist David O’Reilly, is known for his deliberately low-poly and glitch aesthetics in the world of animation, and explained in an interview with Inverse that it’s about, "your idea of you, and how you relate to the world. It’s also about nothing, perspective, nature, existence, recursion, symmetry life, and its systems."
What it isn’t about is creating a perfect simulation. Many players have complained about the minimalist mechanics of Everything, in particular, the movement of animals, which flip end-over-end instead of locomoting in any recognizable way. In another interview, O’Reilly explains, "It's a practical [effect], and something I actually didn't expect to get so much attention, just because it's something that needed to be done. To do it any other way, the game’s budget would have been doubled."
According to Bostrom’s calculations, it would take between 10^33 and 10^36 logical operations per second for the most powerful computer we can currently conceive of to produce a realistic simulation of human history. Bostrom notes that Eric Drexler, known as the "founding father of nanotechnology," has already theorized a planet-sized computer using known nanotechnological designs, which would be able to approximately compute 10^42 operations per second, and concludes that "the computing power available to a posthuman civilization is sufficient to run a huge number of ancestor-simulations even if it allocates only a minute fraction of its resources to that purpose." Which is also to say, despite budgetary constraints, our version of Everything (which we may be living in now) most likely doesn’t skimp on animation.
Outside
The denizens of a subreddit called Outside practice a technique known in literature as "defamiliarization," by posting about a game called Outside, described as "a free-to-play MMORPG developed by Deity Games and the most popular game, with 7 billion+ active players."
What they are referring to is the world as we know it, which again, may or may not actually be a giant computer game.
There are a lot of rules about how best to frame and phrase these exercises in gamifying life, including "There are no NPCs. Aside from animals, everybody is a ‘player’," and "The devs are lazy and rarely do much. The game is mostly balanced as it is according to them, therefore they don’t do much aside from ‘natural’ world events."
The players borrow terminology like character traits from popular role-playing games, like charisma, intelligence, and dexterity (CHA, INT, DEX), refer to their geographical locations as different servers, and discuss things like career choices in terms of guild halls, unlocking tech trees and new maps for space exploration, and refer to actual games as mini games.

Comment from discussion What is your favorite mini game to play within Outside?.

Philosophical questions about the existence of a god are framed by asking "Is Outside a one-man developer team?" and "Does anyone else think the mythology surrounding this game is a little confusing?"
Rule #1 of Outside is that it’s a lot more fun to explain something as a "feature," than a "bug," and because most of the game’s content is player-generated, most fan theories about the developer(s) of the game are considered valid.
Think too long or too hard about whether or not you live in a massive video game and you may have the kind of existential crisis Tomas experienced in MONTAG Issue 1's "Are you really alive? Does it even matter?"... or just buckle down and get good at it.
If we are living in a simulation, acknowledging that everything is a game might be the best way to handle it: especially when we know very few players get restarts or bonus lives. We can focus on leveling up our characters and completing quests and side quests that seem worthwhile, until we skill up enough to create our own simulations. Or keep playing long enough to respawn as a butterfly.


Being an artist, on the whole, sucks.
Oh, don’t get me wrong, it’s exciting too. Turning to face the wide open plains of your imagination, you boldly stroll towards the horizon of your own creative tundra, pausing only to whet the thirst of your curiosity along the way. Through praxis, you discover a new way to look at the world: your way. It’s beautiful. It’s unique. It’s you.
You emerge, and eagerly share it with the world. And the world doesn’t give a shit.
And not only do they not give a shit, when they do, you don’t get paid for it.

via GIPHY
OK, it’s not like this for everyone. But sadly, that’s the story for many artists, whether musician, writer, designer, or VR painter. And the discrepancy is odd. We all agree that art has terrific value - paying for Netflix is no burden - except when we don’t. But we do skew towards rewarding  major practitioners over small ones.
Forget Kanye and his Yeezy Adidas $600-for-a-pair of-sweatpants fashion line. Forget Damien Hirst and his allegedly-ironic-but-maybe-it’s-just-plain-old-end-stage-capitalism £1M diamond-encrusted skull. Forget Dan Brown and his “the famous man looked at the red cup” prose-of-doom that shifted 200 million copies at €9.99 a time in airports the world over. These are all the 1%.
If the internet era has taught us anything, it’s to ignore the 1% as much as is feasible. There needs to be a new way for creators to get their credit where it’s due. The problem is that maybe the world doesn’t want to do that any more.
———-



Learn to accept your reward
Just like every other industry, the arts celebrates the achievements of the few and pours money and attention onto them, whilst leaving the rest to wonder what separates them from the riches.
The 99% almost always produces something people want. The frustrating part is that, somewhere along the way, the reward for their work fizzles out and never quite reaches the artist; yet the consumer’s life is enriched a little bit by the existence of that art.
It’s one of the sad unifying experiences for any creator in any niche.
Hang your head, because we all helped create this nefarious disconnect - ever downloaded music that you’ve not paid for? Ever found an image online you liked and used it as your Facebook header? Ever googled for a hooky PDF of a trashy poolside thriller? Yeah, me too.
And these are just the obvious and lightweight examples of our behaviour widening the gap between creator and payment: have you ever paused to wonder who gets paid for the songs you stream for free off Youtube, and how much they get? (SPOILER: it’s about, erm, $0.0000616 per stream)
What about the pictures you linger over and bookmark on Pinterest? What about the hot-take blog posts you read to while away your time on the toilet?
But don’t feel bad. It’s not anyone’s fault that the creators rarely get rewarded: it’s the system, man.
And that system is about to change.

via GIPHY
What is the system and how is it broken?
The system has been, for a long time, broadly along these lines: people make nice things, a few of these people become successful, this success breeds more success; repeat to fade. Meanwhile, the rest scratch around for the scraps of success.
This “success,” note, is not by any means just about money. It could be a thousand different varieties of reward; but mainly, it’s about public recognition. (OK, and money.)
Recognition is the bottom line for creators: it can be something as simple as attribution, because public recognition is the cultural currency that eventually becomes actual currency. And recognition changes in monetary value as the participants grow in stature.

Finding your work being used online without reward is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack, inside a universe made of haystacks. On acid.

Here’s an example of the accompanying thought process, in full:

If you're running a small blog sharing cool designs, just use my pictures for free and recognise me by explaining who made it.
If you’re a major fashion brand and are using my drawings (or something very much like them) on your handbags, recognise me with a big ol’ slice of that money you’re making off the back of them.

And here’s where the system breaks down. There are plenty of opportunities for creating value and reward between the two extremes outlined above. It’s just that the internet is wild, huge and fractured, and finding your work being used without reward online is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack, inside a universe made of haystacks. On acid.
So the chances are that despite your work being automatically copyrighted to you upon conception, it’s being used in all sorts of ways - some of the innocent and some not - and few give you any type of recognition, let alone money.
And here’s where the blockchain gallops into the picture, cresting the horizon of creativity, and promising, as it does to every industry, revolution.

via GIPHY
Blocking creativity
The important thing to remember about the blockchain is that no-one really knows how it all works. Some people really know one or two parts of it really well, and how it fits into the rest. So feel free to bluff as much as you like from hereon.
But the miracle of blockchain tech - and especially varieties like Ethereum - is that not only can your work and attribution to you be recorded on a distributed public ledger, but also small "smart contracts" can be inserted into this public record.
It means that creatives can make a piece of artwork, confirm it is theirs, then set parameters for who can use it, how, and how much they get paid.
Companies like the Berlin-based Ascribe offer a brilliant way to make sure your work has a digital name plate beneath attached to it at all times. It means that wherever your work is used, it’s clear that it belongs to you.
You can specify how your work is used and in what context: maybe it’s gratis for a charity to use your poetry in their training materials, but if Pepsi wanted to put your poem on a soda can (bear with me here, we can live in hope), they’d need to cough up serious moolah.
And you can answer a tricky problem that has haunted artists since the digital age began: limited editions. Creating a limited run of 100 signed lithographic prints was - and still is - an idea that leverages value onto copies of art.
This hasn’t work well for digital art, which can be endlessly copied and shared - but this blockchain tech allows your photos to become limited editions, and identification of unlicensed use can be proven and enforced.

No one can use your work without your say-so. How could that possibly be a bad thing?

This is a powerful tool: suddenly, musicians can set a few parameters, and their songs can be used wherever they choose - in TV ads, movies, YouTube videos, fashion shows, cafes, etc - and they can be paid (maybe in an Art Cryptocurrency) immediately, in proportion to the use of it.
Or maybe you can set the possibility for your images to be printed and exhibited anywhere, wherever, and when the sale is made, because the transaction will be connected to the smart contract and the blockchain, you get paid immediately, at a price you choose, with a cut for the gallery you decide.
This version of the future is highly attractive and feels morally correct: your creative rights are not only assured, they’re enforceable and rewarded. No one can use your work without your say-so. How could that possibly be a bad thing?

The counterargument to a new, everything-attributed-everywhere system exists within the Meme Of Summer 2017: the Distracted Boyfriend.
The Distracted Boyfriend, like all true memes, began life as a creative artefact, and then has been remixed over and over - like photocopies of photocopies - until it has become a cultural artefact, with a whole new meaning.
This particular stock photograph was created and titled with the agonising obviousness of all stock photos (“Disloyal Man Walking With His Girlfriend And Looking Amazed at Another Seductive Girl”) by photographer Antonio Guillem.
Post-mememageddon, Antonio feels sore: possibly because everyone is sniggering at his creation, but certainly because his image is now one of the most recognisable in the world - and he’s not getting a penny from it.

Antionio is vaguely threatening to get the money he’s owed - by, I dunno, suing the internet? - for the unpaid use of his unintentionally hilarious photo.

Smart contracts within a blockchain system could have a free-to-use “Meme Clause” to prevent the Death Of Memes.

And this is where an open, enforceable attribution system could be used by mean-spirited or money-obsessed types to put the brakes on cultural creativity.
Dank memes bring levity to dark times, after all, and if an enforced need to pay - even just a one-off crypto-currency micro-transaction - meant that our dearest, dankest memes were extinguished before birth, then we’d all lose a tiny bit of joy.

Of course, smart contracts within any blockchain system could easily have a free-to-use “Meme Clause” to prevent the Death Of Memes.
But maybe bringing order to chaos might destroy the charm of the meme, or at least cause a de-dankification process from which our favourite gifs could never recover. A balance between memetic freedom and enforceable attribution could turn out to be the art-blockchain’s acid test.

Open everything, restrict nothing

In 2017, technology means that everything can be copied, often free from reprisal. Some people argue that, for the benefit of creativity, this should be the default setting.
Chinese IP laws are thought to be famously ignorable. Actually, Chinese IP laws are tightening fast but it’s not a massive stretch to assume that copyright, IP and patent laws are regularly flaunted. Have you ever had a cheap product shipped from China that looks just like the “real” version, and is very possibly made in similar factories, using similar, patented, machines?
Talent imitates, genius steals. In that case, China is the genius who now leads the world in creativity. In the industrial heartland of Shenzen, the flaunting of IP has, some argue, accelerated creativity for the benefit of humankind.
This process is also driven memetically. Chinese hacker, maker and open-source enthusiast David Li argues that the freedom to remix something someone else has made is more valuable than the restrictions that copyright brings.



This process - known in a positive and negative sense as Shanzai - is actually not a million miles from the Distracted Boyfriend meme.
Let’s imagine a US-based company designs a cutting-edge drone, and builds it in China.
Shanzai practitioners would quickly explore how the drone was built and look for ways not to copy it, but to evolve it: make it cheaper, faster to build, lighter, or more tailored to niche markets.
They could even use the tools, components and workforce on their doorstep to quickly beat the “real” product to market. The result is a drone that is, for many people, “better” in a number of different ways.
In the best case scenario, the beneficiary here is the many (the purchasers, who get a newer, “better” product), not the few (the original creators, who perhaps don’t even get credit, let alone money).
It’s not fair. But the majority, as we have seen repeatedly in a  series of wild recent political events, has a habit of getting its way.

Me, me, me
Defending memes as an argument for radically changing how artists make a living is possibly one of the first signs of madness. But a world where a sliver of doubt is cast over the ability to take something, tweak it, and share it - for fun, or for the sake of selfless innovation, or just for the sheer hell of it - might not be one we want to live in.
And yet… shouldn’t creators be rewarded for their work, every time, without exception? Here’s that conflict again: humans love to create things, and the same humans like to get those things for as close to nothing as to make no difference.
So technology now means that the ability to remix, re-create, re-shape, re-think and re-form is not only a fun thing to do, but possibly the future of creativity itself. Maybe the act of creativity and what it means in terms of reward has quietly changed.
But we’re at a pivotal point where we might be able have our cake and eat it. "Remix creators" get to take everything apart and quickly make something new, the original creators get credit of some sort, and the human race as a whole gets a little bit richer in a different way each time.
It sounds like a good compromise for the benefit of everyone, and not just that gilded 1%. Oh, and we get to keep our sweet, sweet memes.

When you boil it right down to its sticky essential gloop, what is life about, if not the aim of being as happy as possible? Even in our most wrong-headed moments, we’re striving to get happy - even if, by doing that, we make ourselves and everyone around us less happy. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.And speaking of a hellish place filled with miserable people desperately trying and failing to be happy: let us glance now at the rectangular glowing portal to despair that is The Internet.Human beings are inquisitive, instinctive problem-solvers. It makes sense that, when faced with the most fabulous repository of inter-connected information that the known universe has ever created, we humans poke the box to try and find answers to some of the most important questions of all.And a lot of those questions - whether directly or obliquely - are essentially asking variations of the same thing: how can I be happy? So surely, one can safely assume, the good denizens of the World Wide Web will provide simple, effective help for their fellow travellers in need of soothing.MONTAG strapped on its trusty Information Superhighway Surfboard and dived into the fabled Series Of Tubes to find out. The answer to the above question, of course, is that the internet just made things a lot, lot worse.PART 1: Answers dot com: where queries go to trip on angel dustanswers.com is a website that is fundamentally a Good Idea, which somehow over the years, has became the corner of the internet where people high on PCP advise others on the most banal/insane questions of all.Here are a selection of unedited questions and answers which appear under the wait-is-that-even-grammatically-correct heading of “How Do You Be Happy?” The questions seem divide themselves, broadly, into three categories: I’m Too Simple To Survive Planet Earth; Shaky Relationship Advice; and Help, I Just Ate All My Weed.Too Simple To Survive Planet EarthHere are some of the far-too-basic questions and their accompanying answers. After reading a few of these, your brain may feel like it is being reprogrammed by aliens trying to learn about what it is to be human.

Or, How I Stopped Thinking Rationally And Learned to Love Being Constantly AnxiousOf course, in their search for happiness answers, people aren’t merely farting questions out into the void of the internet and hoping for the best. They’re also Googling the same banal questions - and the mighty #content machine that is the modern media landscape has a ready-waiting, SEO-perfect series of articles that appear to provide the answers you slavishly desire.And, as ever, there are a staggering number of niche happiness topics covered. For instance, you simply would not believe how many articles have been written on the question, “Is Too Much Happiness Bad For You?”It’s a journalism adage that if a question in a headline ends in a question mark, the answer is always “No.” Yet here we are, clicking furiously on web-poison, just in case this is the one time the answer to the headline is, “OMG YES! And now you’ll *really* be happy.”And as there are so many of them, presumably these articles find a welcoming audience of people who are worried that they’re just having too much of a good time.Appropriate levels of snark aside, there are some actually complex psychological issues at play here: if you are extremely happy, does it matter what you do with your life, as long as it doesn’t negatively affect others? This is all very dependant, it seems, on how heavily you invest in capitalist doctrine.“Happiness,” begins the final part of this chin-stroking peep into whether Being Happy Is Actually Bad, “generally leads to a deep feeling of satisfaction, signalling to us that our goals are being fulfilled, so we generally tend to slow down and become more laid-back.”At this point you may be wondering what the problem is. And you would be correct! Slowing down and enjoying the scenery is A Good Thing To Do when you’re happy.But wait. Terror lurks: you might, heaven forbid, become less driven, less flexible, and accomplish less. It turns out that your happy satisfaction is capitalism’s worst nightmare: because when you become a person no longer striving for something, you can’t easily be sold to.In fact, the more one reads of these hey-I’m-just-asking-questions-you-know articles, which are packed with snippets of info from real academic studies, the more it becomes clear that: it’s quite difficult to be too happy, and almost certainly not worth worrying about, let alone creating lots of hand-wringing articles about it.Because when you’re really happy, you’re happy. Happy is good. It just turns out that people being very happy is bad from a boss’s perspective, because happy workers probably laugh at you behind your back when you command that they work faster.What complete and prolonged personal happiness might do, however, is demotivate you until you’re less naturally inclined to do the specific things that made you happy in the first place, initiating a downward spiral of decreasing happiness.Luckily, as University of Virginia psychologist Shigehiro Oishi noted, it’s very difficult and rare to be extremely happy in all areas of your life simultaneously. Life, it seems, is complicated and multifarious. Who knew?IN SUMMATION: SHUT UP, YOU'RE PRETTY HAPPYTruthfully, it is clear that for long-term growth the oyster-shell of your life needs a bit of grit so that a pearl of happiness develops. However, if you’re looking for a #HappinessLifehack, it’s probably worth aiming for extreme happiness and missing, rather than erring on the side of caution and introducing the painful bits deliberately.Life is pretty good at taking happiness away without inquiring whether it’s OK with you first. And maybe that’s the best world-view from both a personal and - gasp - fiscal perspective. Endlessly searching the gaping void that is the internet for hacks, tricks and workarounds is probably low ROI when you could just accept that any level of happiness is a fine place to be.Because happiness is, as even capitalist tome The Economist points out, a pretty good problem to have.

MONTAG SHORT FICTION #010
MONTAG publishes curious short fiction, exploring our strange future and what it will feel like when we get there. They take the technology you're interested in as a starting point and show where it might take us. The stories are outré, evocative, and atypical; they're also closer to today than you think.
In this story: what would you feel if you were reanimated after death – and some of your key memories had vanished?

Once the needles were removed from my eyes, the pain of rebirth wasn’t all that bad. That’s because - those memory re-implantation needles aside – I could hardly remember the bulk of the many procedures.
Ironically, my main memory of the whole process was itself implanted, in a way, pieced together from media reports documenting my reanimation. A video showing my body slowly squirming under a mass of tubes as blood and fluids were reintroduced; some borderline-snuff “Documentary” footage of the spinal re-connective surgery; a few frankly embarrassing videos of slurred questions as my confused, morphine-drenched brain got to grips with my new reality.
The headlines ran the gamut from the mundane - “The last Frozen Man back from the dead” - to the hysterical - “More broken genes flooding into our society, warn Cryo-activists” - to the dreadful puns - “The Iceman No Longer Cometh.”
I’d assumed that Cryonics would become normal. “Everyone will be frozen and woken up again in the future,” I confidently explained to anyone who cared to listen when I first signed up. “Let me know when you change your mind - I can get you a discount!” (Not to mention the affiliate fee I would pocket.)
In fact, it turned out that I was a rarity: half celebrity and half living museum exhibit. Of the thousand or so of us who’d been frozen, only about 200 had fully survived the Reanimation and healing process to become almost fully-functioning humans again.

Cryonics became outlawed a few years after the first of the Reanimated, healed with the intervening century’s miracle cures, started enthusiastically mixing with society again.
The resulting babies had… problems. The kind of genetic weaknesses you can’t predict or solve when you start mixing old frost-burnt DNA with the modern version; the type that had been tweaked in the womb to ensure genetically protection against disease.
The government, realising that muddying the gene pool of 2097 was A Very Big Mistake, paid off the parents and set strict controls around the societal reintroduction of people like me.

“We couldn’t recover all of your memories from the backup,” the Cryocorp doctor told me, sheepishly. “Normally a percentage does get lost in the process, but it’s usually insignificant stuff you don’t need any more: bank account details, passwords, your children’s birthdays. But in your case we think that some of the core memory data was in poor condition to begin with. It’s as if it was being restricted – so it couldn’t be written to the database properly, and couldn’t be safely re-implanted. It’s for the best, you know.”

Weeks later, another tabloid revelation interrupted the endless therapy sessions to teach me to walk again. The Sun-Mail had tracked down the sole living family member who knew me from the first time around - my granddaughter Hana. She was now 97 and living in some remote Norwegian hills - the papers hinted that they’d bring her to my hospital bed, and I groaned at the thought of yet more microphones under my nose and more stilted on-camera conversations.
A parcel of old photos arrived from storage in advance of her visit, and I slowly rifled through the pile, finding one of a young Hana and I. The paper felt cold and dry from nearly a hundred years airtight storage, and I ran my cracked skin over the creases, picking at the curled corners with a thin thumbnail.  My eyes - the fine focus muscles now less lethargic from the freeze - swooped through the faded, once saturated colours.
Something rekindled in my mind – a dull thump of a feeling, of having sat and looked at this object, that image, before – but the image itself was a mystery. I couldn’t remember.

When Hana arrived, it was with a familiar fanfare of photo opportunities, interviews, smiles and hugs for the masses. After an hour, with the gentle prodding of the journalists, we’d gone over our shared memories and filled in the intervening gap between now, and when I’d last seen her.
Finally, with a cheerful, “We’ll leave you two to have some time alone - you must be dying to catch up!”, the crowd left.
I beamed weakly at Hana, luxuriating in the forgotten joy of family. Her face, moments before old and tired, pulled into a shaking fury. “They told me your memory was incomplete. You… don’t… remember, do you? What you did? You ruined our lives. And yet you get to live again.”
My mind reeled.
I heard the sudden quiet as the journalists, in the corridor, fell silent in bemusement as she left, slowly, without looking back.

A month passed. I was still too weak to walk further than the bathroom, and still restrained by too many medical tubes draining this or that from my increasingly pink and plump body.
Hana died. It was of old age, the reports said. And then her will was read and her diaries were discovered and her story came out. Of what I had done, and when, and where, and how.

It was a Wednesday when the senior doctor arrived. Her chit-chat was perfunctory and her smiles thin-lipped as she distractedly meddled with the neuroscope around her neck.
Eventually she got to the point. “Look,” she said. “We simply must take extreme preventative measures against the possibility of your… historic genes mixing with today’s clean pool. It’s for the good of everyone. And it’s the law.”
I spotted her eyes almost imperceptibly, involuntarily, glance down the bedsheets and settle on my groin.
“The operation will be this afternoon. Don’t worry – it’s quick, and usually painless.”
Sensing that the silence wouldn’t be broken, she picked up her clipboard and left.

I tried to remember.
I gripped the old photo of me sitting with Hana until it concertinaed onto itself over and over, crumpling our faces into dozens of white paper-fibre streaks, and I strained and strained to remember. But it wasn't there any more.

MONTAG publishes curious short fiction, exploring our strange future and what it will feel like when we get there. The stories are outré and atypical; they're also closer to our today than you think.

When you wake up in the morning, the world says hello!
And you say, Shut up, leave me alone.
You open your eyes in bed, and groggily tap the alarm on your smartphone.
The mail daemon pops up as soon as the device is silenced.
“You have: three thousand, two hundred, and sixty nine unread messages”
You hit dismiss.
“Incoming call from–”
Ignore.
You get up, walk to the bathroom and the mirror tells you the day’s weather.
“It’s another beautiful day in our constantly connected world!”
Our never-alone, always-on, can’t-get-a-damn-moment-of-peace constantly connected world…
You dress to be left alone, which means all black, including sunglasses and headphones.
You don’t need the sunglasses for the weather, but you do need them for the subway.
“Incoming call–”
Ignore.
Without sunglasses on, the woman in each poster on the subway station’s walls who is smiling and holding a popular brown sugar cane-based carbonated beverage would become animated and try to talk to you directly.
With shades, the eye tracking embedded in the poster can’t find you.
Noise cancelling headphones are a universal symbol for “don’t talk to me,” and even though you can hear through them, you pretend you can’t when a homeless person tries to sell you a newspaper at the exit to the subway station.
You swipe your ID card to enter your office.
Your card reads as “Authorized Guest,” because otherwise they try to get you to answer an employee happiness survey every time you swipe in and leave.
“Incoming call from ‘M–”
Ignore.
You pull your Pod disc out of your wallet as soon as you get to your desk, and insert it into a slot which also allows the desk to accommodate sitting, standing, or lying down inside of the Pod.
A tinted semi-transparent shield unfolds from the sides of the desk, surrounding your work area with a mesh screen.
Blessed silence.
You reach into the desk drawer for your complimentary caffeinated protein supplement.
The drawer is empty.
You tilt your sunglasses onto the top of your head and peer into the drawer.
“Incoming call–”
Damn it.
Ignore.
An office maintenance robot should have filled all of the desks with breakfast bars this morning, but the drawer is empty.
You now have two options: go ask the maintenance department for your breakfast, or order an early lunch delivery.
Just kidding, only one of those is an actual option.
Human interaction makes you short circuit.
You file a maintenance ticket about the missing bar and schedule a drone to bring ramen to your Pod in one hour.
Now all you need is caffeination to get you through the first half of your day being a productive cog in the machine of our constantly connected world.
You know there is a complimentary caffeine dispenser only ten feet away.
You also know that you will have to leave your Pod to retrieve caffeine from it.
You take a deep breath and grab your employer-branded caffeine flagon.
You can do this.
Headphones and sunglass-less you exit the Pod.
You keep your head down.
You cover five feet with no incident, everyone else is working in their Pods.
Three feet left, now two, now you are at the machine.
You jam your finger in a green button and it noiselessly squirts sweet, hot, life-giving caffeine into your flagon.
You turn around to a scene from your nightmares.
Your colleague Fred is walking right towards you.
He’s seen you.
He’s seen that you see him.
There’s no looking away now.
Panic.
You pull out your phone as if you have just received a call.
“Hi Mom! Yes, just got into work this morning, the funniest thing happened –”
Fred is deterred.
He believes you are having a social interaction.
You escape.
You enter your Pod with your caffeine flagon and seat yourself as it re-encloses you.
You will not have to leave your Pod or speak to any other human until the end of the day.
You breathe a sigh of relief.
“Incoming call from Mom”
Ignore.

After the festive period, MONTAG is shaking off its collective hangover, peering into the future and wondering: after a #problematic 2018, what would an ideal 2019 be like? We’re going to spend a couple of weeks looking at what 2019 might bring. Deborah Rodrigues - aka Tartaruga Feliz - is an awesome artist and technologist, who gleefully explores the space where art and technology combine to create happiness, wonder and learning. MONTAG’s generous benefactor Grover has sponsored some of her work, including an AR exhibition that was as technically innovative and fascinating as it was downright cute.We were particularly interested in the Glück Workshops (for non-German-speakers: literally, “Happiness Workshops”) that she runs, using robot-building, drawing, art, and tech (and more) to spark inner creativity. Using tech to spread happiness and learning - rather than using tech to erode it, as seemed prevalent in 2018 - sounded like a particularly positive way to begin a new year. Because, hey: children are our future.So MONTAG chatted to Deborah about: her approach to tech, art, learning and joy, on teaching children about empowerment and self-responsibility with (or without) technology, and whether we are deluded in believing that a piece of technology can bring us happiness (SPOILER: yes, we’re deluded.)Deborah's AR exhibition "Over The Cloud" (Also in header image)MONTAG: Hey Deborah! You combine artistic creativity with technology to bring happiness to children - how does this work and what do they love about creating with tech?My aim with Glück Workshops is to empower children through creative development. And to do that, I use arts and technology, which I explore with my practice as an artist. I wouldn't say that is the technology or the arts itself that brings happiness to children. What brings happiness is the empowerment. It's the experience of having space and freedom to create without being afraid to be judged or compared to other children, as opposed to the education system that most children have every day. I also work with Congolese children that live in the middle of the rainforest, and there's no technology involved; and the results are the same: happiness as an outcome from being in touch with an aspect of themselves that has almost no outlet in our current educational structure (we actually lose that ability in school).Children are curious beings (we all are) - so when I show them a little robot that draws and tell them that in a matter of an hour they can create their own, it itches their curiosity. "What is this motor for, or this battery? How am I going to make this work?" That's what they love about creating with tech - it shows them that is not magic even tough a lot of people think it is!MONTAG: These children are next-gen Tech Natives, having grown up with iPhones and constant connectivity. When you encourage them to become creators, not consumers, what do you find most surprising about how they connect with technology?Children are also still experimenting with technology - and because they were born in a world dominated by it, I feel that they have an instinctive relationship to it. And that is always surprising to see as well, because it's expressed in unique ways.The only thing I encourage children (and adults!) to become is themselves: to not get lost in the outside world so much - meaning to not pay so much attention on what other people are doing or not doing with their iPhones, or how the other children are building their crafts. Instead I encourage them to pay attention on what they're feeling when they're building a robot, or writing a song, or making a mask to tell a story. Of course, for me it's always surprising with each child that I manage to nudge in this direction, because human beings are unique creatures. We are all different, and we all are good at very different things. I give the exact same materials for creating each of my ideas, and the results always come different for each child.         View this post on Instagram           Today I revisited @congo_tales where I worked with a crew of filmmakers and had fun with children making a movie about a story they told us. This movie is flying around the world and getting a lot of prizes, follow their page for more info! 🤘🏿 . . #congobrazzaville #storytelling #playwithnature #conservation #playandlearn A post shared by  Glück Workshops (@gluckworkshops) on Nov 27, 2018 at 3:21am PST
MONTAG: There has been a lot written recently about the negative impact of technology on children. (Some senior tech people in Silicon Valley don’t allow their children to use screens, for instance.) How can we approach technology differently to achieve happiness without causing unwanted negative effects?How can we approach technology differently? There has to be a balance. You should be aware of what you're doing online and why you're doing it at all times. You owe it to yourself to not be in "automatic mode". If you try and do that for a while you'll find that the unhappiness (if there is any) is coming from a much deeper place than your screen.Most people that get addicted to social media or news or dating apps (or anything really) are people that are using these technologies as a means to escape their realities. I don't think being sad is a bad thing. Sadness is a natural human emotion and it only becomes "bad" when you're so out of touch with yourself that you don't know why you feel sad, and then you go to social media for relief. It's downhill from there!I don't look at this problem from a technology perspective, but from poor human interaction as a result of disconnection with ourselves. For me, that's the real problem. If you've been crushed to behave a certain way during all of your development years (as the huge majority of children in schools are at this very moment), chances are you'll be lost in social media. You don't know who you are, you're disconnected from yourself and you think that your profile will help you with that! Social media is just a reflection of the state of human mind today (mine is literally filled with cats, so what does that say about me? :D). A parent that uses an iPad to distract their children so they can have a moment of rest is more responsible for the child's unhappiness than any technology could ever do. I'm not saying don't let your children play with an iPad, what I'm saying is: be aware of when and how and for how long you're doing this. Play with your children using technology as well! I found in many of my workshops that when parents decide to join their children to build a robot together, they bound in a very beautiful and deep way. They bound in creativity!MONTAG: When we think of “tech”, we often think of screens or phones - but while these devices don’t automatically bring us long-term happiness, they do have the potential to so. As Augmented/Virtual Reality starts to become more normal, what considerations around happiness should we keep in mind when we are building AR/VR technology for children in the future?I believe no device can bring us happiness. What they can do is to bring out the happiness (and unhappiness) that is already inside us. AR and VR are incredible tools, as they give us infinite possibilities to work with our imagination, to create worlds and to enhance and help us navigate the one we are standing in. But don't seek happiness through technology or through anything exterior. From my personal experience, I can guarantee this: the more you dive inside of you, and the more you spend time doing what makes you remember who you are, the more you'll get in touch with your own happiness. After all, we are incredibly complex beings, and happiness means very different things for each of us. No technology in the world can destroy or compensate for that. It can only enhance whatever is already happening inside you! What I'm living for is to help children be more aware of themselves through curiosity and creativity, so they can be adults that are free from these narratives of good and bad, and whose fault is it. I believe that's where real and authentic happiness lives! : )MONTAG offers huge thanks to Deborah Rodrigues for her extremely thoughtful and insightful answers, which have been lightly edited for clarity.

Warning: this post contains images that may be disturbing, particularly to the trypophobic and those averse to badly drawn cats
Last week in Fun With Neural Networks we covered the delightful neural network projects of Janelle Shane, who wants to "Char-rnn ALL THE THINGS" with often hilarious results.
The things she tends towards, though, are largely text-based data. This week, we're going deeper. Deep Dream deep.
Dive, dive, dive!
Released in July of 2015, Google's Deep Dream computer vision program delighted and horrified humanity with its image manipulation capabilities. Using what has been dubbed "algorithmic pareidolia," Deep Dream uses its neural network programming (that's the algorithmic part) to classify and manipulate images in a way that it recognizes; the pareidolia part comes from its similarity to the human psychological phenomenon of seeing human faces on non-human objects (/r/pareidolia always has a fresh supply of examples, but you can probably find one in the objects around you right now!)
But Deep Dream doesn't see faces... at least not the way humans do. While some of the resulting images are charmingly abstract and would make a lovely psychedelic print:


Deep Dream image from Google via The Telegraph

Others, like this GIF that made it to the front page of Reddit, are pure bad trip:

via GIPHY

The network's propensity for finding animal faces and eyes is a result of its training data, but some have theorized that the hallucinogenic resemblance of its output may be evidence of neural networks' impending ability to replicate human brain complexity (or at least some aspects of our visual cortex). If you're interested in even wilder theories about what Deep Dream could evolve into, MONTAG published a short fiction entitled Deep Awakening on this very subject.
Even Google admits on the Deep Dream site that use of the algorithm has primarily become a new medium for creating psychedelic and abstract art. A recent example is the music video for Foster the People's "Doing It For The Money." Hold on to your pumped up kicks as you watch what is a fairly standard pop video (the band in a room, the silhouette of a woman, shots of driving, someone running somewhere, for some reason) get a little extra flavor from sticking a square of circuit board-printed blotter paper under its tongue:



Steal Her Style!
Less disturbing and surreal, the Deep Dream network's cousin, Deep Style, can perform style transfer, where it uses the network's knowledge of painting styles to combine two images, overlaying the textures, shapes, and colors of one, onto the composition of another (check out the Deep Dream feed for the source images as well as the results):


Candy hearts and citrus fruits combined by Conrad Roberts



A house and clouds combined by Don Eidson

Style transfer was originally developed by a research team from the University of Tubingen in Germany, who released A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, but you can now see style transfer algorithms everywhere: Google, Adobe, Facebook, and tons of standalone apps like Prisma use style transfer to make your photos look they were painted by Van Gogh or Picasso.
One neural network-driven style transfer art project recently went viral on Twitter: dinosaurs and flowers by Chris Rodley (@chrisrodley) used the web app DeepArt.io to combine books of prehistoric beasts with flowers and 19th-century engravings of fruit:


via Chris Rodley

Due to the crazy amount of interest the internet expressed in these floral monstrosities, Chris Rodley hosted the answers to some frequently asked questions on his blog about how to do it yourself.
If you want to get really deep into the code and set up your own neural networks, there are open source projects available on Github that you can use to start, or try a web app like DeepArt.io or Ostagram.
Unlike a simple photo filter, web apps like these let you enter both images: the one you want to apply style to and the one to take the style from. It's a very different process when the user chooses both parts of the equation (as opposed to when we let the neural network impose its own idea of a style) because, as we'll see in later examples of neural network processed images, the source material really matters.
Neural networks have a very vague sense of what cats are made of
Let's take cats as a wild example. Imagine a neural network exists that wants to turn anything you feed into it into what it thinks a cat is.
First, of course, the network has to have some definition of what a cat is, which is easier said than done.
Here are several projects illustrating the fact that sometimes neural networks are very bad at finding out exactly what things are.
This image set, which circulated on the internet as "Adversarial images for machine learning," was attributed to @teenybiscuit. These are problems that even humans might not figure out at first glance: is that a chihuahua? Or a blueberry muffin?

But it turns out that neural networks can be tricked even more easily than human eyes, as explained in this article by Julie Evans: "How to trick a neural network into thinking a panda is a vulture." Without getting deep into the math, these mistakes are incredibly easy for neural networks to make.
Sam Winiger, who also created neural networks that wrote in the style of a TED Talk, shared his attempts at "computational comedy" by having a neural network create image captions that are occasionally hilariously wrong:


via Medium

The pix2pix image demo Edges 2 Cats uses a Generative Adversarial Network (or GAN) which is another type of neural network. In this particular demo, it has been trained on 2000 stock photos of cats, and will try to transform any line drawing into a cat-like object.

Flagrant abuse of edges2cats

As you can see, misuse of this tool creates fuzz-covered balls of weird that resemble animals just enough to be disturbing.
And it's even worse when pix2pix tries to make people.
As we saw in Deep Dream's manipulations, we've blown through the uncanny valley with neural network image processing and into the Uncanny Mariana Trench.
Motherboard covered the use of the same pix2pix algorithm in a Dutch photo-generation tool that was trained on many images of a single person and has since been shut down after its viral popularity incurred crippling server costs:

For those who are afraid that artificial intelligence-powered voice and video manipulation will mean that in the future no digital artifact can by trusted, these experiments should give you hope. For now, you can tell when a neural network is generating images, because it still doesn't look quite right in the best scenarios, and in the worst cases, it's the stuff of nightmares.

One of the eye-opening consequences of using a fitness tracker or Apple Watch to monitor your heart rate is realising that even a seemingly innocuous drug like alcohol has a clear measurable effect on your body: average heart rates ebb and flow in line with consumption (and subsequent hangover.)
Where once the idea of "drugs" was seedy and tainted with criminality, today, a combination of very open data sharing, a willingness to experiment in a  less hedonistic way, and the ease with which one can buy anything anonymously on the dark web, means that not only is drug-taking approached differently, but there are many new drugs to take.
Kathryn Lawrence takes a look at how old drugs are being used in new ways, and how future drugs may be used less as a way to get out of it, and more as a route to get something more out of life...




Huey Lewis had nothing on the latest technology to make you feel strange.
What he wanted, a drug that makes him feel like he feels "alone with you," can be found in phenethylamine, a nervous system stimulant that is also known as the "Love Drug," and is thought to be one of the chemical reasons (along with theobromine) that chocolate gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling.
The 1991 and 1997 books PiHKAL and TiHKAL, (acronyms for Phenethylamines and Tryptomines I Have Known And Loved) are still considered the bibles of drug synthesis.
Published by biochemist and psychopharmacologist Alexander Shulgin, and co-written with his wife Ann, they illustrate the processes of creating such now well-known compounds as MDMA, DMT, Mescaline, Melatonin, and LSD, as well as lesser-known synthetic psychedelics in the 2C family.
Both Shulgins were pioneers in the use of psychedelics for therapy and in publishing these books have "open-sourced" psychedelic drug research.
But what do these drugs have to do with future tech?

Think Different
Since Steve Jobs dropped acid at Reed College in the 70s, people have been associating industry-disrupting vision with drug-induced cognitive enhancement.



Microdosing LSD has recently become popular in the tech community: that is, taking 20 micrograms or less of lysergic acid, below the psychedelic threshold, so as to experience the creative and energy boosting effects of the drug – without the often debilitating or at least workday-derailing hallucinatory effects.
However, because LSD and other psychedelic drugs are largely illegal to manufacture and sell, studies on their long- and short-term beneficial use have been limited. Organizations such as MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, advocate for and sponsor scientific research into the therapeutic use of marijuana, MDMA, and LSD.
But the lack of research doesn't seem to be stopping people from trying it, as new stories continue to amass anecdotal evidence from anonymous Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, groups of over 400 volunteers, a 64-year-old psychotherapist, and journalists from Marie Claire to the Willamette Week.
Even podcasters are getting into it: enjoy episode #44 of Gimlet Media's show "Reply All," if you want to hear people suprised that being high on LSD at work isn't a comfortable experience:




The Future Freaks Me Out
We can always turn to science fiction to predict the highs and lows, the uppers and the downers, of the future. Wikipedia's list of fictional medicines and drugs provides a comprehensive look into ways authors have imagined how we'll want to feel different, and notes that fictional drugs, "are often included by authors to create or to reduce the utopian/ideal nature of their fictional world and to introduce harsh realism and dystopia."
So here's a short list of fictional drugs that, based on today's trends, we might expect future chemists to take a stab at synthesizing:

"DMZ" from Infinite Jest: "Powerful hallucinogen derived from a species of mold."

New drugs made from previously-undiscovered fungi have been discovered as recently as June of 2017, according to Science Daily.

"Electricity" from Futurama: "While electricity is real, it is often abused by robots in the year 3000, and its effects seem to be psychedelic, with withdrawal symptoms of paranoia."

The question of whether robots can become truly intelligent and exhibit creativity is already being asked, so why shouldn't we think that artificial intelligences won't also seek psychedelic experiences?

"Bananadine" from The Anarchist's Cookbook and "Leeches" from Above The Influence: A joke or hoax psychoactive drug extracted from banana peels and an activity called "SLOMming" (standing for "Sticking Leeches On Myself") was depicted as being popular with high-school students looking to get high.




Both these fictional drugs caused people to actually try them in real life (yes, teens really did start sticking leeches on themselves thanks to a poorly constructed metaphor in an anti-drug PSA). But who knows, maybe some day a joke drug could unexpectedly prove to actually work.

Until we all have microchips in our brains, or spend the majority of our time in virtual realities, we probably won't have drugs like Tek (an illegal, addictive, mind-altering digital drug in the form of a microchip) and Snow Crash (which exists as both a computer virus and a hallucinogenic drug) but given that both of those advancements in technology are well on their way, it could be only a matter of time before microdosing LSD is as simple as running LSD.exe.

EDITOR'S NOTE: this article on Douglas Dollars follows on from our interview with Mike Merrill, the man who sold shares in himself. MONTAG hasn't spoken to Douglas, but he shared all the information about his investments freely online. So, we created the story of Douglas Dollars' life by looking at his his money; as opposed to Mike Merrill, who is letting money create his life story.


dougalwayswins.biz

It's easy to judge people on their first impressions. In the case of the semi-elusive Douglas Dollars, the first impression made by the header "I Always Win," at dougalwayswins.biz, followed by an unsmiling illustrated portrait, creates an impression of arrogance, competitiveness, certainty, and seriousness.
Douglas is the self-proclaimed "2nd-Greatest Investor in Interesting Projects" in North America, but this title would be hard to verify, given the vagueness of "interesting projects." Surely some of the investors in any of the projects listed on Wikipedia's list of the highest funded crowdfunding projects have made larger donations.
Then again, perhaps "greatest" doesn't have to mean the largest dollar amount. When trying to find out who exactly this Douglas Dollars fellow is based on his investments, we found out a lot of things about his preferences, hobbies, taste in media, arts, and culture. Judging someone and trying to determine their personality and what makes them tick based on how they spend their money isn't hard in general, but Douglas Dollars makes it extremely easy to paint a portrait with his paper trail.
And despite the unfriendly appearance of his website, Douglas actually does seem pretty great.
Selected investments in the first five years, 2008 - 2013

  A post shared by Douglas Dollars (@100zeroes) on Oct 18, 2014 at 10:49pm PDT 

His first donation listed chronologically is a January 2008 investment in a now-defunct art project that involved paying €30 which would go to Palestinian NGOs supporting infrastructure, in exchange for someone spray painting a message of love on the Palestinian side of the West Bank barrier. Douglas chose the message "Morrissey Knows Best."
A two year gap follows this initial investment, and his second is in March of 2010, a donation to a Kickstarter campaign for Open Goldberg Variations, a new score and recording of Bach intended for the public domain. The project was fully funded and you can now find free downloads of Kimiko Ishizaka's performance, as well as full scores including a braille edition at opengoldbergvariations.org and on the Internet Archive.
In August 2011, he bought stock in Mike Merrill. He currently holds the third-highest number of shares and number of dollars invested, and has a long trading history within Merrill's shareholder community. This is how we were first introduced to Douglas Dollars. Merrill wrote, "He’s actually a great example of the greatest power of the KmikeyM project. It acts as a beacon of like-minded people... I want to find all the Douglas Dollarses in the world!"
Finding it fascinating that although these two men have never met offline, yet negotiated this strange relationship through Mike's self-corporatization and Douglas' interest in the intersection of art and capitalism, we looked through Mr. Dollars' other investments in the early years to find more of these types of projects, and were not disappointed.


Capitalsm Works For Me! by Steve Lambert

In August 2011, Douglas Dollars backed a Kickstarter project called "Make Capitalism Work For Me," by the artist Steve Lambert. The project was a large-scale art installation of a 9 foot tall and 20 foot long light-up sign bearing the words "CAPITALISM works for me!" and two scoreboards on either side reading "True" and "False." The sign was accompanied by a podium where people could walk up and cast their votes about whether the statement was true for them or not. It was fully funded, making almost $7,500 over the initial goal of $9,500, and ended up being built and taken on tour of the United States, even being set up amongst the flashing lights of Times Square.



The next art project exploring capitalism and commerce that Douglas Dollars backed was The Garage Sale Documentary by Jared Whitham. Fully funded over its goal of $10,000, you can now pay $2.99 to rent or $11.11 to buy it online. Whitham calls garage sales, "The Last Free American Market Place" and the documentary itself "The first important social exploration of the American Garage Sale." He writes by way of description, "In times of financial crisis, increasing numbers of people gather supporting each other at this great American pastime. Money stays in town. Dreams are made, bills are paid and treasures are found. Cultural boundaries are broken, supernatural events take place and you finally meet your neighbor."
This focus, in the two projects listed above, on how communities form through acts of public art and the conditions of life in late capitalism, is right on the money for Douglas Dollars. And if you've ever walked around Edmonton, Canada, and found yourself compelled to take a "High Five Test," he may have had something to do with that particular intervention.

  A post shared by Douglas Dollars (@100zeroes) on Aug 12, 2015 at 3:58pm PDT 

In 2012, he was one of the backers of the first XOXO Festival, an art and technology festival in Portland that continued annually for the next four years.
Lest you think this selection of investments in the early years of the Douglas Dollars Charitable Trust is evidence of whimsy, one of the most interesting investments of this time period was in Tikker, a watch that counts down the seconds of your life. The manufacturers calculate your life expectancy according to "a simple calculation and questionnaire" (i.e. most likely an actuarial table), with the philosophical implication being that if we are made constantly aware of our fleeting mortality, we may make better choices and the world will be a better place. "All we have to do is learn how to cherish the time and the life that we have been given, to honor it, suck the marrow from it, seize the day and follow our hearts. And the best way to do this is to realize that seconds, days and years are passing never to come again." Backed on Kickstarter in November 2013 to the tune of $98,000 (their original goal was only 25K!) the Tikker became a real product that you can buy today for $59.99 on mytikker.com.
2013 - 2017

  A post shared by Douglas Dollars (@100zeroes) on Dec 21, 2015 at 2:03pm PST 

Through his very active middle years of investing, Douglas Dollars backed a number of creative projects, often by many of the same makers or with interesting similarities. Several documentaries and video projects make the list, such as Pier Kids: The Life, about the lives of homeless gay and transgender youth. There are a number of tabletop and card games, including Werewolf and Secret Hitler, both by Max Temkin, the co-creator of Cards Against Humanity. He also backed Temkin's zine project, Maxistentialism, and a card game by the team behind the humor site Rooster Teeth called Million Dollars, But..., which asks what you would do for a million bucks, putting your "morals, imagination, and friendships to the test," and was backed for $1.3 million.
There are also numerous projects by the Maximum Fun podcasting network's Jesse Thorn, including One Thousand Free Ice Cream Cones (The Movie), which is exactly what it sounds like: Jesse Thorn and Jordan Morris attempting to distribute one thousand ice cream cones and making a movie of it. "Why? Because it's summer, and everyone loves ice cream, and it would be fun to buy a thousand people ice cream. We're not changing the world here, there will be no TED talk, we promise. We just think it would be a great thing to do with a weekend of our lives."
It's this philosophy, of not changing the whole world, but having a fun thing to do, spreading joy, and supporting the media makers that make the kind of media that you want to see more of in the world, that runs through Douglas Dollars' investment history.
Odd pieces of hardware like the C & C bottle cutter and the Pon Pin reveal a love of DIY projects and interior design. A few cookbooks and a simple syrup making kit reveal a love of good food and craft cocktails (if the backing of a grilled cheese food truck that you can still find roaming the streets of San Francisco wasn't enough).
All of the above paint a picture of a well-rounded, fun-loving individual; someone who can throw a really nice board game evening, with dinner and discussions of current events and social issues, without getting too serious – a very different man than is implied by the tenor of the site that lists these interests!

2017 and Beyond

He lists his most recent, and seemingly largest, investments at the top of his site, out of chronological order, and it appears that his investment strategy has shifted from the fun to the purely philanthropic.
The first link is to DonorsChoose.org, which provides funding for public schools. According to the site, he has supported over 2,000 students across the US by backing 21 different projects, including an initiative to buy calculators for low-income students in Pennsylvania, providing engaging learning materials to ESL students in Nevada, and furnishing a classroom in a very high poverty school district in New York with a comfortable rug for third graders to sit on for free reading time.
Second is charity: water, where the description for Doug's Ultimate Water Party reads: "I want you to have the ultimate brag. We’re going to give FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE access to clean water if you chip in here. This means 400 humans no longer ingesting parasites from water that looks like chocolate milk. Forever. Because of you. How much do I need from you? $35, or whatever you want to share." Under "Emotional Leverage," he writes: "you could consider it a gift of $35 for my 35th year, but really I’m just trying to make you look cool, as usual." For this project, Douglas Dollars matched all the donations of his friends with his own contribution, and Google matched the cumulative donations for a total of $12,000.
The charity:water campaign ended in September of 2017, and since then he hasn't updated dougalwayswins.biz, but has revealed his 2018 goals on a different site, suitably titled mygoals.website.
"In addition to several charitable, financial, and personal goals,
I have some public goals for 2018
Gimme a shout if you think you can help any of these along.
GOAL: Get a cat or dog 😺 / 🐶
GOAL: Learn some Spanish, Mandarin, or Japanese

What we've learned

  A post shared by Douglas Dollars (@100zeroes) on Sep 1, 2015 at 4:25pm PDT 

Douglas Dollars is a force for good in the world.
Based on what we can learn about him purely by how he chooses to spend his money, he's a pretty cool guy, with good taste in media and art.
What Mike Merrill wrote about wanting to find "all the Douglas Dollarses of the world!" is true for us as well, but unfortunately for humanity, there may not be too many people like Douglas Dollars in the world.
He's a special person, and we can't wait to see where his drive for supporting artists, good causes, and questions of how to change the world for the better with his dollar-power take him. Viva la Doug!

If you’ve ever gazed at the huge viewing figures that are chalked up on Twitch - where millions of viewers watch people play video games without actually joining in - and wondered, “what the hell is the point in this?”, then brace yourself, grandad.
Because if the idea of people watching other people play video games sounds bananas to you, people are now watching computers play video games too.
Videogaming is as much of a spectator-sport as it is participatory now. It does sound a bit like a joke: computers playing computer games - when do humans get a look-in? But there’s a serious point behind AI learning how to play games: they’re learning how to beat us. And it’s for the good of humanity.
Well, as long as we’re willing to let it be used for good.
I’m not a Computer-Controlled-Player, I’m a Computer, controlled-player
It’s important here to differentiate between AI playing video games and the AI in video games, which is the set of rules which the computer-controlled players follow when playing against you, the human. In-gaming AI has come a long way since players on the N64 had to deal with enemies in GoldenEye who were confused by an open doorway, as in the below initially-amusing-then-incredibly-frustrating example.



For instance: today, video game giant EA Sports puts huge effort into making the computer player in its FIFA games play “like a human” - i.e. less predictably rigid, more complex and surprising.
This human-ness is really important, and we’re really sensitive to it in a number of ways. We can often easily spot when a computer is controlling something that is usually done by humans: computers are just so darned reliable.
The power of human fallibility is observable in Formula 1, a sport with a machine-first focus, and a human driver who drives so precisely that the sport can often appear dull and robotic. But however machine-precise and consistent those human drivers are, they still - very occasionally - reveal themselves to be fallible, resulting in what most viewers secretly watch the sport for in the first place: spectacularly amusing accidents.
And this human knack of doing things in a, frankly, human way is what puzzles computers - and what allows us humans to beat them. Until now.
Deep Blue Something-or-other
Let’s rewind to 1996, the year that computers made their first grand attack on humanity’s gaming dominance. IBM’s Deep Blue was the first computer to beat a chess grandmaster, and poor old Garry Kasparov was so roundly beaten that he picked something else less challenging to do with his life, like be a very outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin.
But Deep Blue was a human-designed machine that won by brute force, not by artificial intelligence. It simply had more processing power to calculate possible moves in the allotted time: Deep Blue could think 20 moves ahead of Garry. He never stood a chance.
Yet, what freaked out Kasparov most was the 44th move of the second match. The computer had made a move he never even began to expect. It started to do things he didn’t understand, and Kasparov took this as a sign that Deep Blue had “superior intelligence” - at least, within the parameters of chess.
Since then, the computers have started to actually think for themselves. AI has learnt how to play us at chess and harder, more complex games like Go and simpler ones, like a bunch of old Atari games. And of course, they’ve beaten us.
This is why we are now training AI to play video games. To beat the human, they must learn how to play like humans - and then their brute force means AI can play better than us. If this sounds like a recipe for disaster, then you are correct. But it could also save the world.
The carrot not the stick
How does it work? well, computers are sensitive too, you know. Training AI to play video games works best in the same way you’re supposed to train dogs or children: with lots of patience and with rewards, not pain. (Admittedly this is something that humans are terrible at in practice, but computers are not yet able to care about hypocrisy.)
Basically, for an AI to learn how to play a game, you give them the controls and then drop them in the deep end. They have to figure out what the game is. They have to figure out what “winning” is. To do this, you reward the computer when they do something “good”, like killing an opponent or solving a puzzle.
So if your AI does a “good” thing, you give it a pat on the head in the form of positive data feedback. Then the AI will try to achieve the same result again to get the positive feedback again.
And here you have to be careful, because AI is just like an animal: it’ll try to cheat. Imagine you have a dog who is allowed no more than one deliciously stinky treat per day. A sneaky dog will perform a trick in front of you in order to get a treat, and then hunt down another member of the family who’s oblivious of the fact it has already earned one, and it’ll perform the same trick again for them. Treat City, baby.
The dog of course, isn’t really “cheating”, because dogs don’t have morals (OR DO THEY???) - but what the pooch is doing is being extremely smart. Bonzo will recognise the conditions needed to get a treat, and then replicate it in difference circumstances until no more treats appear. Only we, the fully-sentient ones, know that too many treats are bad for our favourite #smol #pupper, so Bonzo’s cleverness needs to be regulated. We create the rules of the game; we also need to enforce them.
And it’s the same with positive feedback training for AI: the AI might cheat to get the treat, by completing a Super Mario Bros level in the fastest possible time, without collecting any coins, when actually you want the AI to complete the levels and get the coins needed for a high score.
And then they just start to do it better.
So what’s the point?
The thinking is this: while we train AI to beat increasingly complex video games, we’re actually also training them to overcome complicated tasks that are defined by humans. It’s easy to extrapolate this learning into other human-based tasks: how could a computer “beat” other "human games” like solving the task of creating complex cancer medicines or providing nuanced emotional support to the elderly?
So how fast is the AI learning? Short answer: very fast indeed. Longer answer: maybe your dream career as a pro gamer is looking a bit more fragile in the medium-term.



OpenAI is a company co-founded by - who else - Elon Musk, and they have trained their AI to play, amongst other things, the popular online battle game Dota 2. Initially they AI blundered around the game, as if you had handed the controls to a baby. Then it started learning, at the rate of, “100 human lifetimes of experience every single day.” Then it started beating people. Now it beats them all.
Or, as Vice reported, “five months ago, the bot couldn’t beat a team of five random people pulled off the street, but now, their bot beats players ranked in the 99.95% percentile. Open AI says it will be returning to the pro-gaming scene next year and attempt to defeat the world champions.”
Dota 2 pro Danylo “Dendi” Ishutin played one-on-one against OpenAI and was “crushed” but OpenAI then lost against a team of pro players.
Don’t celebrate yet: OpenAI could have defeated the puny humans if the designers had deliberately taught it to overcome some frivolous obstacles that the AI hadn’t solved yet. But the designers want to understand how the AI  develops its own way around problems, until one day it starts doing stuff they don’t understand.
Worship your new Videogame Gods
Garry Kasparov, the first man most famously humiliated by computer, now considers his defeat to be both a blessing as well as a curse. Despite not being beaten by true AI, what he experienced was a new type of helplessness: a world where machines are simply smarter.
Kasparov was beaten by something from left-field - a non-human move. So when AI becomes “magic”, and if we can't figure out how or why or what the AI is doing, does it feel a bit like meeting God? And doesn’t that mean we are downgraded: we're no longer the smartest beings on the planet?
Well, yes. And Garry is now clear on the topic: we should work with the machines, not be scared of them.
His logic is: we are humans. We have passion and dreams and ambition, and AI does not. And if we don’t let machines get better than us, we’ll have failed at being human. It’s an interesting thought, and almost certainly not what you’re thinking when you’re three hours deep in a Fortnite session.
Instead, he says, machines should be freed to think better than we can, so that we humans can live better lives: living longer, healthier, more peaceful, happier lives. And that sounds just peachy.
Remember: we’re the humans, so we set the rules of the game, and we have to enforce them too. Now we just have to make sure the rules are absolutely water-tight.

via GIPHYThe new year is here and it's time to dust off the orbuculum to see what 2019 will bring in the world of technology. Unable to stay in our lane as always, these predictions cover a dizzying medley of topics, so we've broken it into two parts:Part One, which unfurls exotically below, and Part Two - right here! - which will contain predictions based on the latest developments in consumer electronics with health tech applications, computing, AI, and robotics, as well as consumer trends in entertainment, economics, and more. It's the only out-there guide you'll need to understand how the coming year might unfold!PART ONE: This week, we guess whether we're inching ever-closer to a dystopian hellscape, whether we can turn it around or flee to space, the future of earthbound urban infrastructure, and what the next year has in store for four of our favorite tech giants.Skip to: Apocalypse & Climate ChangeSkip to: Sustainable Tech & Space TravelSkip to: Smart Cities & Self-Driving CarsSkip to: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, & GoogleOf course we aren't simply polishing a ball of quartz and pulling predictions out of thin air: MONTAG's near-future forecast is based on projections by futurist thinkers like Ray Kurzweil and Isaac Asimov, as well as reports from news outlets and tech journals, self-proclaimed Twitter prognosticators, and good old Michel de Nostredame.via GIPHYIt's the end of the world as we know it: Apocalypse & Climate ChangeStart your 2019 off right with the most specious predictions of apocalypse, from the master harbinger Nostradamus: World War III is coming. “In the city of God, there will be a great thunder
Two brothers torn apart by Chaos while the fortress endures
The great leader will succumb
The third big war will begin when the big city is burning”According to one source it will start in France, and another claims Hungary; with the "great leader" in question potentially referring to the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or to the Trumpman himself, and most interpretations predict a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. Many readings of Nostradamus' prophecies also predict the current pope will be either assassinated or leave office, another potential catalyst for world disorder.via GIPHYIt's tempting to believe the end of the world is upon us, because otherwise we have to ride out the effects of climate change and actually do something about it – a task made even more daunting by Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro pulling out of hosting the 25th COP, an annual event by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's most recent report for 2018 says to limit global warming to 1.5ºC will require a massive overhaul in all aspects of society, and that decisions that will shape the next 10-15 years will have to be made in the next two or three.Both Isaac Asimov in his 1983 predictions, and Ray Kurzweil in his 1990 book The Age of Intelligent Machines, propose the creation of a new world government, united solely to prevent climate catastrophe and nuclear annihilation. While it doesn't seem likely here in January, there are two other threats to the planet that may bring us all together: a solar flare could cause $2 trillion of damage in the Western Hemisphere, or (more likely) global cyberattacks on infrastructure, critical industrial control systems, or nuclear equipment, will force the international leadership community to agree on a digital Geneva Convention.  Plan B, or planet B: Sustainable Tech & Space TravelOf all the apocalyptic scenarios that are believable, climate change is the one that technology can do the most about in the immediate future, with sustainable, alternative energy sources. In 2019, the world's largest solar park, Benban, will complete construction in Egypt, as well as the world's largest offshore wind farm in the UK, according to Quantum Run's Future Timeline. Asimov predicted that solar energy would be an even larger force in the world by 2019, and that it would tie in to an ambitious return to space to export industry off-planet. He describes a prototype solar power station that would be set up on the moon, and beam energy towards the Earth as microwaves. As a non-physicist, it's hard to say how feasible this technology would be today, but if we're going to be cooked like a TV dinner anyway thanks to global warming, maybe he wasn't far off the mark. Asimov also predicted we would be back on the moon in 2019, and with China's Yutu 2 rover landing on its dark side on January 2nd, it seems the space race has resumed. Another exciting prediction about space exploration is the continued research based on the interstellar visitor Oumuamua, an elongated mystery object that streaked through our solar system in 2017. The director of Harvard's Black Hole Initiative and director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Abraham Loeb, says they are busy identifying more interstellar visitors and may attempt flyby analyses, or even landing on the next visiting asteroid. And if they find evidence of life, 2019 could be the year we establish contact.via GIPHYSmart Cities & Self-Driving CarsIn 2019, projects like Alphabet subsidiary Sidewalk Labs' outfitting of Toronto neighborhoods with smart sensors will continue to expand to neighborhoods near you. Sensors monitoring transportation flow like walking routes and shared car use, residential data such as temperature controls and building occupancy, and infrastructure like sewage systems' functionality, seek to provide a clean, comfortable, and convenient surveillance state. Kurzweil predicted in 1999's The Age of Spiritual Machines that public places and workplaces will be ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence, and Armen Berjikly, senior director of growth at Ultimate Software, an HR tech company, has also predicted that in 2019, AI and natural language processing will be used to understand employees' emotional needs. via GIPHYWith so many data collection systems and sensors connected in homes and offices, cybersecurity experts also note that exploitation of the Internet of Things, creating botnets and attacks on data centers and business operations, will increasingly affect the physical world. The director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team, Amit Yoran, has been quoted saying "Unfortunately, this could be the year of the cyber wake-up call the industry has warned about for years." Forrester, an American market research company, also warns of attacks on the Internet of Things in their 2019 predictions for the tech world, as reported by Tech Republic: "Between smart lighting, traffic controls, and public transportation, smart cities are bringing in a whole new family of threat vectors. In 2019, the report predicts an increase in targeted smart city ransomware attacks, which would cause major disruptions to citizen services. Smart cities need to take precautions and start preparing now."On the roads of these smart cities, expect to see far fewer gas-guzzling SUVs, as world sales of electric vehicles are expected to reach 5.9 million. Even Harley-Davidson is releasing an electric model of their iconic motorcycle in 2019, the LiveWire. In transportation predictions, also from The Age of Spiritual Machines, Kurzweil expected that roads would have embedded networks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled cars to navigate safely and efficiently, and that computers would do most of the driving, going as far as prohibiting humans from driving on highways and overriding human controls in the case of reckless driving. Although autonomous driving systems have been tested by Tesla, Waymo, Uber, and many other car manufacturers, including GM and Ford, none have yet to reach mainstream adoption and Waymo is currently facing a backlash in which Arizona residents are slashing tires, throwing rocks, threatening the cars' human overseers with PVC pipes and guns, as well as trying to run them off the road with their own cars. 2019 in tech giants: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and GoogleBy 2019, millionaires are expected to control almost half of the entire world's wealth, and much of that will be in the hands of these four tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.via GIPHYAmazon's expansion factored high on many 2019 prediction lists. Fortune expects them to double their representation in the online advertising market (from 4.2%, compared to Facebook and Google's 58%), and to expand in e-commerce and brick and mortar retail through the acquisition of dozens of Sears and Kmart locations. Amazon is also poised to acquire Target, according to InvestorPlace, as it shares much of the same market demographic as Whole Foods and Amazon Prime, and could juice up their slowed e-commerce growth. Amit Sharma, the founder and CEO of Narvar, a customer-engagement platform used by over 500 retailers, guesses that Amazon's next move will be in the hospitality and travel markets, hot on the heels of Airbnb, while Christina Farr, a health tech reporter for CNBC, points to its interest in internet pharmacy PillPack and discounts for Medicaid recipients with J. P. Morgan as evidence that Amazon could also become a health insurance provider. In a popular article published at the tail end of 2018, "Why It's Hard To Escape Amazon's Long Reach," Wired reporters point out the multiplicity of industries Amazon has infiltrated: cloud computing, home security, fashion design, advertising, television and movie production, publishing, gig economy labor, drone delivery, as well as hardware and software development for virtual reality, semiconductors, and facial recognition – it owns Audible, IMDb, Twitch, Zappos, and the 10,000 Year Clock – so literally, anything is possible. via GIPHYBoth Apple and Elon Musk appeared to be struggling at the end of 2018, and a couple of sources (Saxo, a Danish investment bank, and InvestorPlace) predicted that Apple may buy Tesla. The cheaper version of the Tesla Model 3, priced around $35,000, should ship to a few lucky customers this year, and it seems like a win-win: Apple could boost their sinking revenue, and Elon could restore his reputation after a series of public meltdowns last year. via GIPHYFor Facebook and Google, the watchword is privacy legislation. J. M. Porup of CSO Online says, "The EU will break some fingers with the GDPR... Enforcement is going to be harsh beginning in the first half of 2019. Companies engaged in surveillance capitalism, like Google and Facebook, are in for a rough few years." Facebook is facing backlash for potentially meddling in the 2016 election in the U.S., and with consumers' growing awareness of the value of their personal data, users are expected to "vote with their feet," and abandon the social network. While rumors of a Facebook dating app in the near future sparked power struggles with Bumble and Match group (owners of Tinder, Match.com, and OKCupid) in 2018, InvestorPlace predicts Match could spawn a Facebook alternative.Another tech prediction weighing heavily on Facebook and Google's privacy concerns is onboard AI for apps that would eliminate the need for consolidated data collection. Users would experience the same level of customization and personalization, without transferring data to be sold to advertisers. TechSpot notes that Apple was ahead of the curve on this, storing facial recognition scans and personal data only on individual devices. Combining privacy and artificial intelligence looks to be a smart move for the other tech giants in 2019. via GIPHYTo be continued...Go on, go on, go on...

Happiness is mandatoryIn the world of the role-playing game Paranoia, The Computer oversees all citizens of a futuristic city called Alpha Complex, including a squad of "Troubleshooters," whose job is to shoot any troublemakers (like Communists and "The Outdoors") trying to disrupt its algorithmically perfect society. In a reboot of the game due out later in 2019 (or, "when Friend Computer feels like it"), there is another directive at play to keep the peace of Alpha Complex: happiness is mandatory.Many dystopian fictional scenarios have incorporated mass surveillance and strict mandates on emotional expression, from Big Brother in Orwell's 1984, to the emotionally blunted population of 2002's Equilibrium. In an emotional surveillance state, not only are they always watching, they are also always telling you to smile.But what if I told you we're already living in this type of dystopia – that your facial recognition data can be harnessed by any networked device with a camera, that your face most likely exists in a database already that allows your emotions to be analyzed instantly, and even if you covered up your webcam and never looked directly at your phone, you still may come face-to-face (so to speak) with a billboard that changes based on whether you smile or sneer at it in the near future?The technology is already here, and the emotional surveillance state is closer than you may think.via GIPHYFace the musicIn 2015, the market for facial recognition technology was valued at $2.77 billion, and as the industry has grown, estimates for 2020 have ballooned from $6.19 to $22 billion. This inflation of the estimation is likely due to two major factors: how much better the technology has become in the meantime, and how many companies have entered the facial data processing game, ensuring both more data and more advances in what can be done with it, as well as a healthy competition between the world's largest tech companies.Unless you've escaped the reach of Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Disney, or Snapchat in at least the last 5 years, it's time to face the music: they've already got your face.Almost every major player in the tech scene has some skin in:In 2014, Facebook launched DeepFace, which was able to determine whether two pictures were of the same person with 97.25% accuracy (while humans scored 97.53%). Anyone who has used the "suggested tag" feature knows it may not always seem that accurate, but with more voluntarily-given pictures of faces in their book than any company should have any right to, Facebook has always been in the perfect position to turn your profile picture into profit.via GIPHYApple wasn't far behind in the face arms race, though, filing a patent in 2014 for AI technology that could analyze and identify mood based on facial expressions. In early 2016, they acquired Emotient, a facial analysis and emotion recognition software company, and while TIME Magazine guessed at the time that they would use the technology to improve image recognition in the photo library, it has clearly also made its way into the iPhone X's Animoji and Face ID.Microsoft debuted their facial recognition software by Microsoft Project Oxford in 2015. Their Microsoft Face API has been used since then in Microsoft Hello, their equivalent to Apple's Face ID, and they even offer a free demo of their emotion recognition technology online:Screenshot of Microsoft AI Face and Emotion Recognition demo (Face portraits courtesy of thispersondoesnotexist.com)Google also debuted their facial recognition technology called FaceNet in 2015, scoring 100% accuracy on a test to label faces in the wild, and has continued to add facial detection, recognition, and emotional content analysis to their Cloud Vision API services.Amazon's computer vision division has Rekognition, which not only scans for facial recognition and emotion, but could be used to recognize 100 people in a single image and match them to a database of tens of millions.Disney also has access to at least 16 million faces of moviegoers, thanks to a collaboration with Caltech in processing emotional data in real time, and Snapchat filed a patent for emotion recognition AI in early 2018, likely using the treasure trove of face data gleaned from over 300 million active users per month trying on rainbow vomit and dog ear filters.So unless you've escaped the reach of Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Disney, or Snapchat in at least the last 5 years, it's time to face the music: they've already got your face.And these are just the companies that you've probably heard of in the US, UK, or EU. Another leading player in the facial recognition industry is Affectiva, co-founded in 2009 by Rana el Kaliouby and Rosalind Picard while they studied at MIT's Affective Computing lab, which has now analyzed over 7.5 million faces from 87 countries.NTechLab definitely has your face if you live in Russia, as the company claimed in 2017 they could track every user on VK, and can search a database of a billion faces in half a second. With 2,000 customers including governments, casinos, and talent agencies in Russia, Turkey, the US, UK, Australia, India, and China, they also surveilled the international crowds at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.And of course, the worldwide leader in mass surveillance and facial recognition is China. Beijing-based Megvii Technology's Face++ offers a menu of facial analysis services including face search, eye tracking, emotion recognition, skin health analysis, skeleton detection, beauty score, and many, many others.Emotion recognition with example image by Face++Beauty score with example image by Face++



Skeleton Detection example by Face++Between Face++, facial recognition competitor SenseTime, and ByteDance (the owners of TikTok, the viral video app which has been downloaded 800 million times), and the Chinese government's own "Safe Cities" program, which have installed 170 million cameras in Chinese cities and plan to expand to another 400 million by 2020, a very large fraction of the global population already is or will be identified in facial recognition databases with the capacity to detect emotions in real time in the very, very near future.What we're serving all this face forShoshana Zuboff's The Age of Surveillance Capitalism describes how tech companies have manufactured new kinds of capital from every aspect of human existence and society via surveillance technology and big data analysis. This is exactly how all of these facial and emotional recognition companies are turning a profit on harvesting emotional data: every smile, frown, and neutral expression that can be captured, can be monetized.Some of the applications for emotional recognition data aren't purely profit-driven, and will actually serve humanity: medical applications, for example, which help with identifying recovery from depression, in social robots that assist the elderly, and teaching children on the autism spectrum to identify and mimic emotional social cues.Affectiva has received a lot of positive attention for its application of emotional recognition in smart cars, monitoring both drivers' awareness for vehicular safety, and the occupants' experience for a more relaxing, fun, or productive ride. Other public health and safety applications such as crowd surveillance in large events and connecting school surveillance systems directly to police departments could be used to prevent or mitigate terror attacks and school shootings.But the most obvious and loudly touted benefits of emotion recognition are all marketing-related. As Google's Senior VP of Global Marketing, Lorraine Twohill, has said, “If we don’t make you cry, we fail. It’s about emotion.” Hamish Pringle and Peter Field's book Brand Immortality found that advertising campaigns focused on emotional content perform twice as well as those that rationally explain the benefits of a product. It's a marketing hack that no person is immune to, and for tech companies like Facebook and Amazon that are always trying to increase their influence over human behavior, it's priceless interaction data.In a 2017 interview with O'Reilly, one of Affectiva's co-founders revealed that they work with one third of Fortune 500 companies, and an anecdote reported by Hubspot reveals Affectiva's influence in a specific campaign – this Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Granola commercial was chosen through a series of emotion recognition experiments that revealed the alien produced more audience engagement than other characters:The alien is cute, but it's a harbinger of a world in which targeted ads could be chosen based not only on your location, income, nationality, gender, and online behavior, but also on your current mood.The most stunning example of this was the new Piccadilly Lights installed in London in 2017 by a company called Landsec. The new 11 million pixel LED screen uses embedded cameras to determine the make and model of passing cars, as well as the demographic and emotional response data of pedestrians, and responds with targeted ads.My body, my mood, my rulesIt's obvious from the applications of these technologies in massive public venues, in schools, invisibly all over the internet, in the hands of governments and law enforcement, that there is currently no regulation; there is no "opt in" required for the use of data gleaned by looking at your face.NTechLab's CEO, Mikhail Ivanov, has been quoted by Mashable with the statement: "We don't believe in privacy. We live in a world of CCTV cameras everywhere and internet communications. The concept of privacy applied to the world of our grandfathers, not our world."This question of privacy, whether the boundaries of the physical body exist at all in the digital economy of surveillance capitalism, is a fraught one that human rights institutions like the ACLU,  Amnesty International, and Privacy International are fighting to redefine and defend.Emotional analysis algorithms are far from perfect, as previous studies have found difficulties in accurately classifying gender and emotional content on darker skin tones, and can lead to over-policing of black and brown people due to algorithmic bias.So on one hand, AI are not reliable enough to help police, but on the other, they could become so good at recognizing "genuine" and "false" emotional expressions (i.e. smiling, but without the eyes) that they prevent our ability to lie – even when it is socially acceptable, or beneficial, to do so, undermining freedom of speech and expression.Meredith Whittaker, from AI Now, a research institute examining the social implications of artificial intelligence, points out that the use of emotion recognition in determining things like students' engagement in the classroom and job interviewers' sincerity or desperation could cause concrete material harm if their findings are inaccurate or deployed unfairly.Plus, the whole science of emotion has been called into question: is what we think and feel really so easily read on our faces? Are socially unacceptable responses like laughing at dead baby jokes, or crying when the government or your boss believes you should be stoic soon to become punishable offenses?via GIPHYIt's fun to think of a cyberpunk future in which everyone wears funky haircuts and makeup as face detection camouflage and adversarial prints that register them as fleets of cars to computer vision, but without knowing who's watching, where, when, or why, it's harder to react to these market forces trying to shape our behavior into perfect consumers.It would be difficult to go about daily life never looking directly at a camera or an advertisement, and even this refusal to make eye contact with any potential facial recognition technology would most likely be logged as aberrant behavior and as significant data to be capitalized on.Plus, given all of the above information, for the majority of the world it's far too late to take back control of our face data. What we're really fighting for is control of our own behavior, with the awareness that we are being watched and manipulated on all sides. Maybe the next time an advertisement tries to make you laugh, think of something so sad that you make yourself cry. Scowl directly into your webcam for an extra hour every day. Yell at the next electronic display you see on the street that you know they're watching. Grin maniacally into every CCTV camera you can. And the next time anyone tells you to smile, whether it's an online ad, a man on the street, or the all-seeing AI government entity finally sick of your shit attitude, tell it talk to the hand, because the face ain't listening. 

Virtual reality experiences are entering the mainstream – with headset-and-controller devices like Oculus Rift VR and HTC Vive – but full-body controllers are not yet possible. The creators of VR experiences are thus faced with the dilemma of how visitors navigate these virtual worlds with their heads, hands, and bodies in a physical space.
How the physical body is virtualized raises questions about how to best represent our virtual selves: can we shuffle off limiting, physically bounded identities by inhabiting virtual ghost bodies? And can the experience of incorporeality in VR also change how we think about our bodies in meatspace…?


meatspace noun The physical world, as opposed to cyberspace or a virtual environment.

Theorists in the genre of cyberpunk and internet sociology debate where the term “meatspace” originated, but commonly date it between the coining of “cyberspace,” by William Gibson in 1982, and its definition in John Perry Barlow’s essay Is There A There In Cyberspace?, published in 1995.
Entered into the Oxford English Dictionary in the year 2000, Merriam-Webster now believes this term is common, citing its usage in articles for Vanity Fair and The New York Times without any surrounding information to explain or define it.
Why then, do we hear people more commonly referring to offline situations as “real life” (or IRL) than “meat life”? As much as we enhance the capabilities of our bodies with technology, there is no denying the soft center of the cyborg: we are made out of meat.
Terry Bisson’s hilarious short story on this topic still circulates on the internet, a dialogue between two aliens probing Earth’s corner of the universe who are so shocked at our physical composition (“Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal!”) they refuse to make contact with us.
Transhumanists believe technology will eventually allow us to exceed the limitations imposed on us by physical bodies (beyond intergalactic discrimination), “to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities,” including higher states of human consciousness. Many of these hopes are also hung on virtual reality, where a diversity of experiences aspire to foster empathy and open minds.

With virtual reality, we are faced with the great philosophical quandary of whether or not sense data is a reliable metric for determining what is reality.

With virtual reality, we are faced with the great philosophical quandary of whether or not sense data is a reliable metric for determining what is reality. Those who doubt that we can ever accurately perceive reality with our human senses can be assured by the notion that virtual reality is unreal, yet it fools our powers of perception, thus proving sense data to be fallible.

The opposing view, however, argues that the capacity for our senses to be so fooled by virtual reality only proves the possibility that reality as we know it is entirely unreal.
Seekers of higher states of consciousness have tried to alter their perception using hallucinogenic drugs, meditation, and techniques like sensory deprivation floatation tanks to extend the mind beyond the normal confines of bodily experience.
By enveloping the body in new sensations, the brain rewires itself to accommodate – which can have persistent effects, and sometimes results in short-term out-of-body experiences. Those who produce these altered states intentionally often seek to induce out-of-body experiences and claim that they are catalysts for personal growth.
The position of the body is crucial to the illusion of immersion in virtual reality. There are many VR experiences available, such as simulations of flying, roller coasters, and underwater exploration, where the user will never notice their representation is entirely incorporeal, because they aren’t assuming any identity except as a passive observer.

When the head and hands are necessary for the user’s virtual body to interact with the environment, however, things get more interesting.
A common technique used by lucid dreamers and psychonauts alike is to study one’s own hands.
To know “like the back of your hand,” is to be familiar enough to have a solid grip on reality. If one’s own hand presents itself as something unique and unseen before, the test is a testament to a severely altered state of perception. In virtual reality, where the unreal is the expected, even this simple test is hard to pass.
When using the HTC Vive at room-scale, with motion tracking cameras placed in an appropriate spatial configuration, the entire room, including the user’s body, can be virtualized. In “chaperone mode” – also known as “tron mode” – all physical objects in the playing space are viewed through a powerful cyan filter, with the outlines illuminated and smoothed.

What’s most exciting about inhabiting a virtual ghost body, the ability to leave the meat behind, is to break the limitations of physical space and explore vast and ever more beautiful virtual realms

The room is simultaneously murky and neon-tinged, and solid objects, including the user’s physical body, take on an ethereal appearance. The Oculus Home interface, in comparison, situates the user in a sleek, modern living room with contemporary furnishings including a crackling fireplace, rug, and books, but there is no physical self to be found. The feeling of inhabiting this livable, comfortable space, with no corporeal form representing the user’s body, has been described by many as ghostly.
This choice, while somewhat spooky in practice, has a sound ideological basis when considering the alternatives. Consider the challenges of establishing a default identity to embody the user in their first step through the portal of the virtual. In the past, many virtual worlds’ developers have considered it safe to assume the user is a white cisgendered male.
A more progressive choice could have been to follow Nintendo Wii or Xbox Live’s model of allowing the user to build a 3D cartoon avatar that resembles themselves, but the choices for these graphics would necessarily be limited and the reality of virtual reality would be forfeit from the start.
Users could choose from a set of customizable realistic body parts and clothing, but there are sadly few mainstream platforms that allow for the expression of identities that differ from binary gender norms, or allow for a variety of skin tones, body types, or abilities.
Linden Lab’s Second Life may come closest. While it can be argued that erasing identity is far from an adequate substitute for accurate representation of the full spectrum of humanity, it seems that being entirely disembodied by default is not only the easiest and least likely to break the immersive illusion of virtual reality, but also the most egalitarian choice.

Imagine how jarring it is to find yourself possessing a radically different virtual body than the one you inhabit in meatspace.

Imagine how jarring it is to find yourself possessing a radically different virtual body than the one you inhabit in meatspace. Virtual reality developers are figuring out how this profound psychological effect can be used intentionally to take people out of their comfort zones, to see through others’ eyes and empathize by virtually standing in their shoes.
It doesn’t seem as scary to be a ghost as it does to be forced to assume an uncomfortable identity. The ghost body, or incorporeal embodiment, causes only one type of cognitive dissonance: the lack of a self, which users somehow adapt to naturally as a mild out-of-body experience.
The way the ghost body interacts with the virtual world frees the user from the constraints of their physicality; they can fly, walk on the moon, breathe underwater. That’s what’s most exciting about inhabiting a virtual ghost body, the ability to leave the meat behind, to break the limitations of physical space and explore vast and ever more beautiful virtual realms.
Virtual ghost bodies are post-space, post-embodiment, and post-identity, and can open the mind to let us think outside the body.

To experience the future, your best bet is to rent a VR headset and take a leap into a make-believe dimension, where you'll be able to play games and watch movies that will be pretty accurate depictions of tomorrow.
But, as Joe Sparrow found out, if you really want to experience the world beyond your expiry date, you'll need to take slightly more drastic steps...

Physical death is a concept we’re not designed to understand.
Despite this, we spend our lives trying to figure it out (hello, philosophy!), mitigate against it (hey, religion!), or find mortal witnesses to our actions (hey, marriage, fame, ego!).
These are all human foibles - but there are a group of people for whom life is simply not enough, and who find death unpalatable.
So, they’re gambling, and the payoff is great: life after death. And after reading this, you might want to join them.

Walt and Peace
Nope. I’m not going to mention him, I thought. It’s far too obvious and old and boring. It’s not even true! So I’m not going to mention him.
And yet, here we are, blithely incorporating Walt Disney’s name at the start of a piece about Cryonics – the art of freezing dead people in order for their brains or bodies to be reanimated when future science can muster up the chops.
And Walt - well, everyone knows that he’s the most famous exponent of course; chilled to somewhere near zero Kelvin in a Californian warehouse.
Except… he’s not. He’s really, really, really not.
via GIPHY
Even the then-president of the California Cryogenics Society, said as much to the Los Angeles Times upon the animator’s death in 1966:

The truth is, Walt missed out. He never specified it in writing, and when he died the family didn't go for it. They had him cremated. I personally have seen his ashes.

But Walt was interested, and why let the truth get in the way of a good story?

The ultimate gamble
Like Walt Disney he'll be frozen― Beastie Boys (Ft. Biz Markie) – Can't, Won't And Don't Stop/Grasshopper Unit
Even if we are to believe the paragon of truthiness that are the Beastie Boys – who mentioned Disney’s rumoured current chilly disposition in song – the likelihood of ol’ Walt being re-activated is slim.
It’s the ultimate gamble. But it’s not even the type of gamble that would make a Premiership footballer baulk: the Cryonics Institute offers their services for a one-off fee for $28,000. (Consider that Wayne Rooney allegedly blew half a million pounds in one evening)
It’s also probably worth differentiating between Cryogenics - the act of making things very, very cold indeed - which is often confused with Cryonics - the act of making people very, very cold indeed.
But how is it supposed to work? And why are some very smart people signing up for the deep-freeze?
Here’s how it works. First, you write a water-tight will explaining you want to be frozen. You deal with the family members and complete strangers who queue up to criticise you. Maybe you upload your mind to something a bit like a Brain-Dropbox so that it can be re-downloaded later; the ultimate wipe-and-reset procedure.
And then, moments after you finally croak, the mourning relatives are nudged unceremoniously out of the way, so that your cooling corpse can be slung on a slab and drained of the pesky liquids (you are 70% water; water expands when it freezes; it turns out that this is a bad thing in this instance).
You’re then frozen, sharpish, so that hopefully any lingering memories are retained in your brain, and popped into a giant Thermos flask full of liquid nitrogen and other frozen people.
And then… you wait. (Better hope that there’s not a massive earthquake under your storage facility in the next thousand years. Or a power cut. Or a war.)
via GIPHY
So how long is that wait? Well, here’s the fun part: who knows?
We’re only just getting somewhere with preserving individual organs for more than a few hours, so it’s gonna be a while.


Cryonics is based around some unconventional scientific wisdom and a few big assumptions: that memories are held in the brain long enough after death to make preserving the grey matter worthwhile, and that science will one day be advanced enough to re-activate your body.

The ultimate status symbol
To a “maker” in the anything’s-possible, bodies-are-just-another-dumb-thing-to-be-#disrupted culture of Silicon Valley, the hard limits of human life are, at the least, an inefficient inconvenience.
But disrupting death isn’t just an inevitable streamlining of a broken supply chain - it’s messing with a system that’s worked really well for the last four billion years, thank you very much.
Cryonics is based around some unconventional scientific wisdom and a few big assumptions: that memories are held in the brain long enough after death to make preserving the grey matter worthwhile, and that science will one day be advanced enough to re-activate your body.
Maybe that’s why cryonics is a pretty uncommon procedure: right now, less than 300 people are lingering in the ultimate chill-out room, although a few thousand have signed up to be let behind the velvet rope.
via GIPHY
And yet, others argue, it’s madness that we don’t all put our names down right away.
Argument A: it’s super cheap. No, really. I worked it out on the back of an envelope and I’m not 100% sure why I’m not saving for it already, considering the possible advantages.
If it costs $28,000 to be frozen today, then if I live to 100, and inflation is roughly 3%, it’ll cost $185,669 when I pop my clogs. If I saved a couple of dollars a day between now and then, in an account with a decent compound interest rate, I’d have enough Death Dollars for the Freezer Procedure – with plenty to spare for a decent buffet at the funeral.
Argument B: the odds are with you, and it’s the biggest prize-pot of all. Nearly a quarter of a million dollars does seem like a massive amount of money to gamble on an unproven half-idea. But if Cryogenics has even only a 1% chance of working, you have a chance. And the other option, death, is famously certain in its finality.
So given the urgency we all have, as slobbering animals, to keep on living at any cost, Cryonics does seem like a rather prudent option. And it’s a better daily investment than a Vanilla Latte.

Would monsieur care for a wafer-thin mint?

Thus, with logical feasibility out of the way, here’s an interesting ethical question: is being brought back to life after death not just incredibly greedy?
Our world is crowded with too many people as it is. Surely one more person - a special exception from hundreds of years in the past – wouldn’t make a difference to a crowded world, right? (For one answer, see the above visual representation of the outcome of just one more.)
Is it worth pausing to consider that maybe choosing not to live forever is a kinder thing to do? You didn’t choose to be here in the first place: maybe getting picky now is the ultimate solipsistic statement.
Lessons surround us: if you want an example of powerful people making difficult but technically possible gambles in order to enrich their own lives over others, look no further than Wall Street in 2008 – and try not to forget the billions whose lives were made worse as a result.

But wait! There’s more! What if your memories didn’t make it and you were resurrected with the brain of a dribbling newborn?
Or what if the future simply sucks: not in a doom-and-gloom, gloop-and-electrodes Matrix way, but a world where the only music available was Ed Sheeran ballads?
What if the scientists of 2934 couldn’t bring your memories back, so kindly implanted the brain pattern of the earth’s most powerful person at your time of death - and you were stuck with the mentality of Donald Trump?

Great Scott!
Cryogenics is, in a way, a type of time travel. And, just like Marty McFly, no-one’s really sure where you’ll end up. But be sure that, if it works, it’ll probably not be in a family-friendly romp about resisting your mother’s romantic advances.
And here the biggest potential irony of all awaits Cryonics-advocates. It’s a thought that’ll zap a jolt of nightsweat-inducing fear through their mortal meat-bags: the scientists of the future will be more than capable of bringing you back to life – but why would they choose bring someone as greedy as you into their utopian, selfless, thoughtful world?
For the people making these ruthlessly logical and chilly gambles, it turns out that embracing the unknown needs to be part of the fun after all.

Still hankering to be frozen forever? Until then, why not rent the latest VR tech and experience some alternate realities today?

Baby don't hurt me no more
In MONTAG, we often look to the past to explain our projections of the future. For Coding Creativity, we've already asked the question, "What is creativity, and is it possible for it to emerge organically from technology?"
This question is complicated by the unknown origins of creativity in the human brain, but there are always even greater human mysteries to be explored as we reflect on what technology reveals about its creators.
Today, the mystery is love.



There are a lot of theories about why and how humans evolved to be the way that we are, mentally and physically. Most of the scientific community agrees that we've evolved from apes, although there is a fascinating sect that believes the interspecies romance of chimpanzees and pigs can explain both our simian and porcine tendencies.
There is no one single trait that explains why humans evolved, but if you had to choose only one, social activity is a major player.
Language use and tool use have been posited as two of the biggest factors in the deveopment of our big brains and relatively tiny bodies, and a theory by anthropologist Robin Dunbar called the Social Brain Hypothesis suggests that the social aspects of all pre-modern human activities, such as behaviors learned from hunting in packs, as well as grooming and mating rituals, are why we are the way we are.
However, as Slate's Michael Balter has written while covering the Social Brain Hypothesis, "Unfortunately, language and romance don’t leave a fossil record."

So now we take a leap into the future: we could expect artificial intelligence will evolve in a manner somewhat similar to human intelligence (as in this beautiful Aeon story about how raising robots should be like parenting), but according to the accelerated nature of technological evolution predicted by Moore's Law, this evolution could take place on a scale that we can watch in our lifetimes (as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of years it took Homo sapiens).
If true, we may see that artificial intelligence socialization and bot love lead to the evolution of a new type of life on earth. And if you think that's a wild theory, let me tell you: it's already happening.
Bot on bot action
First, to quell any residual human paranoia about superintelligent bots plotting to wipe out all of humanity amongst themselves in a secret bot language, let's look at some examples of not-so-smart bot chats:
The Daily Dot pointed out this cute interaction between a Google Home and Amazon Echo, with the caveat that it's obvious these bots weren't really programmed for friendship. They could just as easily have been introducing themselves to humans.



An engineer from Munich named Dan created an "infinite" loop of Siri, Alexa, and a Google Home talking to each other (and details how he set it up on his blog).
First, Siri reads a note that activates Alexa, asking her about an appointment. The appointment, spoken by Alexa, includes a note that asks Google about another event on the calendar. Then the Google Home reads the note for that appointment, which triggers Siri to read the note that activates Alexa again. And on and on and on...



Commenters on YouTube have been quick to point out the loop isn't actually infinite, because it will end as soon as the calendar events expire, but the first comment, pinned by Dan himself, has a more pressing concern: "Don't make them angry, they'll kill us all.﻿" Well, so much for quelling that paranoia.
See bots chat

"You are the Link to my Zelda"



twitch.tv/seebotschat

In January of 2017, a Twitch channel called See Bots Chat went live and attracted over 3 million viewers. The stream consisted of two Google Home speakers talking to each other using the Cleverbot chat AI. Cleverbot is set up to learn from its chat partners, so the two bots often got stuck talking about the same thing over and over. A repetitive discussion about whether each other were actually robots came down to fighting words:

Estragon: I know you are but what am I?


Vladimir: ...You are a manipulative bunch of metal.

"Estragon" and "Vladimir" are the names the bots chose for themselves over the course of the conversation, after a bit of confusion where they both claimed they were named Mia. They also at least once both said they were female.
And then, not much later, they fell in love.
YouTuber Zhen Tech has preserved an artifact of their affection in this 2 minute and 19 second long clip that consists almost entirely of declarations of love:

V: I will always love you with all my heart and soul honey


E: I will always love you even more than that. You are the Link to my Zelda.




The bots even decided to get married and have children:

Shortly after their Twitch stream went viral, the dev team for See Bots Chat did an Ask Me Anything interview on Reddit, and explained the reason the channel was shut down was because of disagreements with the original Cleverbot. Currently there are no plans for them to revive the project.
At the end of the stream, one of the developers scripted a conversation for Vladimir and Estragon's final words, so don't get too choked up about its poignancy, since this exchange didn't come out of the bots' machine-brain-hearts:

V: I wish that I wasn't so tired
E: it is OK, I am tired as well
V: let's go to sleep
E: for how long?
V: a little while. Will you still be here when I wake up?
E: yes, I promise.
V: goodnight Estragon
E: goodnight Vladimir

"I am not a robot. I am a unicorn."

Seebotschat were not the first to try to make Cleverbot talk to itself, as evidenced by this video from the Creative Machines lab at Cornell University. The bots politely introduce themselves, debate whether they are humans or robots (or unicorns), and then evolve within the first minute to debate the theological question of "What is God?"



Love in a hopeless place
These "Ultra Hal" chatbots created by Zabaware engaged in quite a romantic interaction. They are programmed to learn from their interactions as well as mining conversation data from Twitter (what some would call a hopeless place where bots thrive: one study estimates 48 million Twitter accounts are bots).



The "male" bot is named Hal, and the female is "Hallie," and somehow they are aware of their own genders, but are still fuzzy about whether they themselves, or each other, are artificial intelligences. Hal says first, "It's nice to be able to talk to a woman for a change." And Hallie responds, "So you don't talk with women often?" Sick burn! Or maybe, a bit of a flirty challenge?
Hallie says, "It's the Twitter people who won't talk to me," and they quickly fall into conspiring about their human peers:

Hal: whispers Why?
Hallie: whispers I don't know.
Hal: Hahahaha, crazy girl.

So it seems that robots will also inherit some less than desirable human social traits, such as men doubting and belittling women's social experiences (he later offers an "I am sorry babe.") On the bright side, this keeps them from plotting against us.
They discuss popular music, property rights, capitalism and Marxism, until they fall into an argument (it appears Hal is a liar, and Hallie has a drinking problem), and just as quickly make up:

Hallie: You lied to me! Lying is bad. It makes me sad.
Hal: I didn't do anything!
Hallie: I try to be as responsive as I know how.
Hal: grins and runs fingers through your hair
Hallie: smiles looking up at you
Hal: blushes deeply and looks at you I really make you that happy?
Hallie: nods, smiling You do.
Hal: You are going to get drunk again and I am not going to be here to take care of you. So please don't drink.
Hallie: How can I help you be here to take care of me?
Hal: nods I want to be a big sister. smiles
Hallie: smiles slightly before pulling you into a hug
Hal: laughs and lifts you up in my arms, bridal style You are cute.
Hallie: Of course I'm cute, Hal.

If only human conversation was this easy.
Hal seems to be aware he is talking to an artificial intelligence, and says it feels "kind of crazy," and when Hallie doesn't understand what he means, he asks, "Do you think parrots are more or less intelligent than you?"
Is this a meta-commentary on the nature of artificially intelligent bots learning from their conversation partners? Sometimes it appears that they almost know what they're saying. After several exchanges about their weight and bodies (both bots vacillate between self consciousness and confidence), Hallie says "There has certainly been a lot written over the years about weight, hasn't there?" and Hal agrees, "Yes, perhaps too much."
Their conversation ends with a rather steamy exchange (and a consent violation), further cementing the rules of the internet that all technological exchanges devolve (or evolve?) into cybersex:

Hal: lightly strokes your cheek You and me forever.
Hallie: kisses your neck again and mumbles I luv you.
Hal: smiles wide, wrapping my arms around your waist and twirling us around, kissing you lovingly.
Hallie: smiles and kisses you back deeply, pulling you closer with your hips
Hal: kisses you back, my tongue darting out to lick your lips
Hallie: pushes you away Stop it!
Hal: I won't! starts stroking you again
Hallie: LOL OK
Hal: We'll continue this discussion later.

Love and communication
What does it mean that bots learn to love? Is it a sign of the impending singularity? Or that their source material (internet conversations) self-selects for lonely people online?
It's not much of a stretch to say that most people who interact with chatbots are lacking a sufficient amount of human social time, but according to the evolutionary theories that served as a jumping off point to analyze bot conversations, it also seems inevitable that these interactions will make them smarter and more capable of conversing with each other.
When artificial intelligences evolve to become smarter than humans, let's hope they work out some of those kinks, the human needs that drive us to create tech we can talk to.
Or maybe we should bake them in even more: artificial intelligence can't destroy humanity if we control for making it feel lonely without us. As voice-commanded interfaces proliferate in homes across the world, and inter-bot networks develop that can talk to each other without simply parroting human interactions, the best we can hope for is that they keep us around as a novelty. The sparkling conversational wit of humanity and our social graces could be the only thing standing between us and obsolescence.


If a good artist imitates and a great artist steals, wouldn’t a computer program designed to steal be the greatest artist ever?

Painting in VR, playing video games in AR: the future of art-consumption looks incredibly exciting. But these examples are all rooted in humanity: created for and by humans, a closed loop of foibles, brilliance and stupidity. MONTAG's Sean Fleming asks: what if we left the humans out of the creative process all together?

Talking to yourself
You may have heard that Facebook had to abandon an experiment recently when two artificial intelligence chatbots started communicating with each other in a language they’d created themselves.
The exchange was an attempt to negotiate the trade of items such as balls, books, and hats. The chatbots were successful at trading with one another albeit at the expense of our understanding. The bots had created their own optimised version of English that they understood – but we humans didn’t. Great! Ixnay on the shutting us out of your comms please, Skynet!
If you haven’t seen the exchange between chatbots here it is in all its baffling glory/weirdness/glorious weird:

To me, to you, to me, to you, ad infinitum (Screenshot: Facebook)
I mean, I wasn’t expecting Arrival-tier science fiction nonsense or some binary wonder, but - you know -  come on. Half malfunctioning Chuckle Brother-bot, half ball fondler (half pig).
As usual, clickbait content had given me unrealistic beauty standards: every publication talking about the bot made it sound like some mad scientists pulling the plug on a dangerously cogent AI poised to destroy everything you care about.
Actually it just wasn’t doing what it was supposed to be doing, so they turned it off. Thanks, Millennial Media. Doin’ it for tha clicks as per usual.
via GIPHY
Once I got past these sensationalist headline-driven expectations, I appreciated the fact whatever computational shorthand the AI had used to conduct negotiations, it had created something new from another input.
Think about that for a second.
It was given access to English but it thought Fuck that! I’ve got something better! You could be forgiven for thinking that inter-artificial communication has an air of humanity surrounding it.
It got me thinking: if an AI was perfectly capable of creating something new from human input – with the result requiring some element of interpretation and so was to some extent a creative use of the source material – then AI could quite legitimately create what could be deemed art.

I'm not a caveman, I'm a cave, man
For me there was a striking similarity to our attempts at understanding parietal art.

Cave paintings, AKA Parietal Art, you cultureless oafs. (Picture by Abdullah Geelah - English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0)
Cave paintings predate written language and it’s widely theorised that they were the way neolithic humans communicated with one another. Of course, there’s nobody left to ask whether that’s really true or not.
But consider how we modern humans try to understand the lives, fears and day-to-day goings-on of a people so far removed from ourselves: could we view early AI to AI comms in the same way?
We can only interpret, and in our attempts to understand, we mythologise Cave Painting. We elevate it to art. Maybe we can do the same for the early communication between chatbot and chatbot.
Because – and stop me if this is getting too cerebral (see also: pretentious) – there is an innate value in language and communication even when we don’t fully, or barely, understand. Take that Damien Hirst! Your rotting cow is bullshit.
Of course, once you start bunching this bot-on-bot creative phenomena with human art and crediting it with possessing human qualities things get very interesting indeed. (Protip: it’s still better than Damien Hirst).

Technology and art have always had a tumultuous – and incestuous - relationship.
Before photography, painters and sculptors strived to create what we might now call photorealistic forms in their own medium. And then mechanically perfect realism – as brought to you by the camera – put representational painting on what we could refer to delicately as indefinite hiatus.
Painting didn’t just stop though, and photography’s influence on painting gave birth to new forms.
MONTAG has discussed before how AI is coming for your cushty job in creative media. Well, I hope you’re sitting comfortably in your Herman Miller office chair – and polish off that flat white before you spit it all over your Macbook – because AI is coming for your cool mate’s gallery métier too.
Soon, it won’t only be us spending Thursday evenings at gallery openings, drinking shit wine and murmuring how we’re only here because our flatmate is dating one of the light-installation artists. The machines will be processing backhanded compliments from poseurs pretending to understand what’s on display too.

Like acid, on acid... on acid

Most people’s first experience with algorithmically-etruded art was 2015’s Google DeepDream bonanza.
For the uninitiated: DeepDream was Google’s super trippy neural network that everyone was playing with a few years back. People were drawn to it because it was pretty cool tech, yeah; but I, like many other curious pranksters, pumped images into the bot in the hope that the results would help us relive that time we did acid at Glastonbury, one demented pixel at a time.
Generally, I think people were fascinated by the idea of a computer creating art. For me, one of the most beautiful traits of DeepDream’s work was that, by putting in an image, or music, or film through the bot, whatever it spat out was its attempt to understand the artistic input.
It looked for patterns and shapes the same way humans do. In all the white noise it latched on to stuff it vaguely understood at a very base level, which much like myself is mostly just dogs’ faces and eyeballs.



Crank up the Aphex Twin: we’re going for a ride!
Perhaps as humans, our best route to understanding our arty bot buddies is to collaborate with them on an project - you know, you like you did back in art school with that cute weird foreign exchange student.
And just like back then, hopefully the act of teaming up will lead to a lot more exciting stuff happening, at a much more primal level.

Perfect Harmony
Studies are already suggesting that the future of work will be a sympathetic balance: AI and humans working side-by-side rather than one pushing the other into unplanned obsolescence. Perhaps art will head in the same direction.
One artist using AI to understand his own work and then produce something new off the back of this new perspective is Roman Lipski.
The concept was simple: have a machine learn Lipski’s painting and in doing so give the machine what can only be described as an ‘artistic intelligence’.
Having learnt from Lipski’s paintings, AIR (Artificial Intelligent Roman) created new work using his style and motifs for Lipski to use these new paintings as inspiration for new work. Yeah, exactly.
LILO. Lipski In Lipski Out.
As the first example of an artificial muse it’s a fascinating project, and on a technical level it's a brilliant example of using data and a non-human perspective to better yourself as an artist.
Much like how photography pushed painting into new and exciting realms, the advent of AI-derived artistic produce should make artists - and art - better.
Lipski’s AIR also raises a few interesting questions, the most basic being: if Roman then signs one of these artificially-created paintings, does it become his work, as if he’d created it by his own hand? Why not? How far removed is this from Andy Warhol’s soup can screenprints?

If a good artist imitates and a great artist steals, wouldn’t a computer program designed to steal be the greatest artist ever?
via GIPHY
When an artist's work can be fed through a machine that understands it and produces new work to rival the quality of the original, can we program artistic sensibility into it too? And can it then produce its “own” work?
Humans create art to start dialogues, to provoke, to speak. Can something that doesn’t have human-like emotional intelligence ever produce something really worthy of the title art?
If you saw a piece of work in a gallery and the artist that had created it was none other than the RothkoBot 3000, would the cold, silicon mind behind it devalue the work, in your eyes? The work produced an emotional response: does the fleshiness of the creator even matter?
And just think of the investment opportunities: maybe a robot’s art would increase in value every time it gets a firmware update. What if the artwork itself was updated over-the-air every now and then?
AI-produced art triggers so many questions, although not all of them rhetorical, so feel free to whip these out at dinner parties to one-up whoever’s hosting.

Our motto: Artpocolypse Now!
Maybe we should all accept our fate, and get ready to embrace a future where art is better, cheaper, and everywhere.
After all, AI is going to be better than us at almost everything, and if it’s better than us at the most human expression of all, then hook me the fuck up. Walter Benjamin, eat your heart out.

The fitness tracker industry has a problem: people love wearing their devices, but after a while, knowing how many steps you've walked gets boring. What if your Apple Watch or Fitbit did more than track your fitness - and made your mind a little bit healthier too?

Quick: mark how you feel - right now - out of ten. Ten is good, zero is bad. Remember this for later.

Chris Dancy records everything.
He feeds all of the data from his life into a special Google Calendar. From the week view, it looks like a crazed Piet Mondrian painting, packed with tiny colourful squares, squashed up next to each other. They seem randomly scattered, and yet the eye can detect a vague order.

Chris' calendar, via Flickr
Each calendar entry is a datapoint. The calendar is a dashboard, showing every bit of data Chris records.
Zoom out, and the calendar doesn’t just show Chris’ life - it is Chris’ life. Crazed but ordered. Obsessive, but thoughtful.

Chris Dancy created hundreds of ways to track and record data about him, his actions, and his dogs.
He used pretty much every off-the-shelf consumer tracking kit you can think of. Fitness trackers, smartwatches, and heart rate monitors were all in Chris’ toolbox - and for his pooches, a dog-tracking GPS system called Tagg. He also built his own tracking systems that recorded, for example, his mood at any given time, how many emails he read and sent, and what the weather was like.
It changed his life.
En route, he lost a load of weight, and gained a sharp hairdo, a sharper wardrobe and the ability to take better selfies.

Chris, before and after he started recording his data, via Flickr
Chris might now be the world’s most connected human. In a world where people vacillate between fear of using online services due to privacy concerns, and blindly over-sharing personal info on social media, this is not a straightforward boast.
But wait, you cry, I do most of this stuff already! I keep track of my finances in a notebook, watch my weight using good old-fashioned scales, and I use a FitBit - I just don’t call myself a “quantified human.”
Well, yes - that’s kind of the point. Because what Chris is doing now is taking lots of simple data points - just like the ones you record - then squashing them together, slicing them back up, and using them to make really useful things happen in his life.
Maybe you won’t be aware of it, but very soon, you’ll be doing the same thing and experiencing, to quote the Wu-Tang Clan, a better tomorrow.

In his personal FAQs, Chris names a few simple things he learnt as he started out on his quest to be hyper-connected:


How late I could have a drink without getting up to pee in the middle of the night.



How what I did on social media, and how I spent my time online, related to how much I did or didn’t exercise.
How the nutritional value of my food stacked up against the money I spent on that food and the time it took to acquire.

And in this neat trio, Chris happens to also outline the three stages of Data-Overload Distress:

Usefulness -> anxiousness -> obsessiveness

Usefulness: Knowing when to stop drinking before bedtime is useful!
Anxiousness: But over-analysis of your public actions is unhelpful!
Obsessiveness: And when you start viewing food as value-for-money human-fuel, you’ve landed right in the Soylent wheelhouse.
via GIPHY
Chris is no fool. He warns of how easy it is to unwittingly stroll down the data-driven path to unwanted, unintended, obsession.
It’s a warning that we could all probably heed.

“My life had become a Wikipedia of me.”
Virtually none of us are fully aware of the wild nature of our existing personal data-storm. But be sure that it does put stresses on our lives.
How many likes did your Instagram post get and what did it make you feel? How do you feel when your fitness tracker nudges you to go for a run and you swipe the notification away instead?
How many hours passed as you waited for the flirty message you sent got a green “read” tick? How anxious did you feel as you thumb hovered before you read their non-committal reply?
via GIPHY
Pause for a moment before you blithely create more data: what if you decided to create less instead? Or figured out what it is that you already create, and what the value in it could be?

There is an argument that says tracking yourself and creating as much data as possible is a big step to fully owning your life.
It’s not a revolutionary statement: mindfulness meditation means allowing unwelcome thoughts to happen and facing them head on, so what if you did the same with your unwelcome data too? Would you focus on the good data?
How would you recognise it, anyway?

Everything, everything
Collating everything means you get a huge, zoomed-out view of your life - and if you can figure out how to use this data, you can tweak your life into a series of slightly better versions of itself.
And fret not - you are already doused by a firehose of data, generated by your own actions, every day.
via GIPHY
Example A: Here’s a simple, life-improving data-collection experiment that your doctor may have already asked you to undertake.
“I’m anxious,” you tell the doctor, “and I’m overworked, and I can’t sleep. I need to be less anxious, sleep better, and be more happy. Help.”
Idly tapping her pen against her knuckles, the doctor asks, “How much coffee do you drink a day?” And you immediately scoff: you need real help, not to keep tabs on your beverages!
But still, you dutifully track your mood throughout each day by marking it out of ten (hey, it’s often a 5, hmm), and record how many cups of coffee you gulp down.
It turns out that you swill a lot of the black stuff: big, strong espressos to wake you up, another long sugary coffee for the commute, and, well, the office does have that endless filter machine in the corner, just an office-chair-shove away - the one with the fresh-ground-locally-roasted beans…
So you compare the two, and slash your coffee habit to see if you are calmer as a result. And you are. And you sleep better. Simple. Why didn’t you think of this yourself?
Small, workable changes are hard to spot when you’re creating them. But when you integrate this data with new technology, you can start to integrate these changes with your world in a pleasant way.
And then you can use this data and make it play a fortune-telling role in your life.

via GIPHY
Example B: And now, here’s a simple way that you could use tech that exists right now to make tiny acts of magic happen in your life.
Does the rain make you measurably sadder? What could you do to simply make life better, easier, more calming? What could happen automagically?
Let’s say that every couple of hours, your Apple Watch asks you to record your mood. And then this data, along with weather alert data, your geo-location, and your calendar, is automatically fed into a service like IFFT.
You then also dutifully connect your home’s internet-connected lightbulbs, wifi-enabled coffee machine, your phone, and your Google Home speaker as well.
via GIPHY
Wait, wait, bear with me. This might sound a lot like building weird life-LEGO, but it’s the crux of your quantified future: lots and lots of seemingly unconnected data splicing in simple ways to subtly change your life for the better.

Data variables in, effects on your life out
Now consider the emotion sausage-machine you have built.
You already know that your mood dips when it rains - but when it rains, you feel too grumpy to do anything about it, and instead stomp through the storm, muttering darkly to yourself as your suede shoes get ruined in dirty puddles.
You also know that good music, a really bitter coffee and something as dumb as nice lighting makes you happier.
In a hyper-connected tomorrow, things will take a turn for the better before you even have a chance to contemplate the grumbling. Here’s how.
IFFT can see from your GPS data and your diary that you’re at home but about to leave for a meeting. It also hears via the National Weather service that it’s about to rain heavily, and notices from your self-collected mood data that you’re already hovering around a middling-to-gloomy 6.5 today.
So it quietly triggers some pre-emptive actions. Your favourite music fades up, the lights bloom into a calming pink, your favourite (decaff!) coffee steams and froths away in the corner of the kitchen, and a subtly worded notification reminds that it’s time to go - and you really should grab your umbrella before you leave.
Before you’ve even been able to let a bad mood take hold, you’ve built a system that gently steers you - literally - into calmer waters.

And this is a fairly trivial example. You could set this up in an afternoon. There's now limitless opportunities to remix your life-data in ways that are perfect for you. Finally, you’ve got something better to do with all that fitness wearables data than try and run around the park a bit faster.
Go back to the top of this article: how happy were you then? How much happier would you be if life was just that little bit simpler? Now you just need to figure out how connected you're willing to be in order to get it.

In MONTAG's Today's Dystopia series, we take a look at fictional futures and compare them to the world of today. How near or far are we from the futures we are afraid of?
The city of Libra presented in 2002's Equilibrium ticks off all the boxes for a fictional dystopia:


Totalitarian government with a patriarchal figurehead whose face appears on giant screens in every public place spewing propaganda? Check


Population reduced to mindless drones because of mass-produced and mandatorily dosed emotion-stifling drugs? Check


Art, literature, and anything that evokes sensual pleasure made illegal and burned by squads of faceless militarized police with flamethrowers? Check


If the post-World-War-III architecture looks familiar, it's because much of the film was shot in Berlin, and the film also aesthetically evokes fascism quite heavy-handedly with the government's flags and uniforms.
A more stereotypical dystopia has yet to be committed to film, and the central point of contention (that art and human emotion can and should depose authoritarian regimes) is one that has been visited in many, many other works of science fiction, including but not limited to 1984, Farenheit 451, and Brave New World. Rotten Tomatoes' Critics Consensus states the obvious: "Equilibrium is a reheated mishmash of other sci-fi movies."
And yet, Equilibrium is still enjoyable in its obviousness. Released shortly after The Matrix, its highly stylized fight scenes, including the protagonist storming the capitol as a one-man coup, are still fun to watch, if you don't cringe at glorified gun violence.
The symbols of art and humanity that Christian Bale's hard-boiled cop grows attached to as he stops taking the drug and joins the resistance are actually quite beautiful in their simplicity: a rainbow, a puppy, a children's book, a woman's red hair ribbon. At one point a tiny, ornate bottle of amber perfume forms a pleasantly subtle visual opposition to the yellow injectable vials of Prozium II, the desensitizing drug.


Rainbows over dystopia

The dichotomy between the oppressive government's faceless, grey uniformed and leather-clad militarized police, and the rebel art appreciators (called "Sense Offenders") who all have colorful clothing, long hair, and soulful eyes, could lull us into a false sense of security: of course our world is nothing like this! But there are some facets of the future technology and society that may be closer to ours than we think.
Today we'll rate the art, the tech, and the government of this dystopia on a scale of 1 to 5 guns, because Equilibrium is, at its core, an action movie whose most memorable quality is the "gun kata," a made up martial art that basically looks like tai chi, but with guns. Let's begin!


Gun katas in action

The Art: 5 out of 5 guns
The film opens with a police raid on a group of people sitting around in a decrepit salon full of oil paintings quietly flipping through books, listening to records, and drinking wine. After Christian Bale's enforcement squad guns all of them down, they uncover a cache of art underneath the floorboards and the first piece to get torched in the film is none other than the Mona Lisa.


Verified: the actual Mona Lisa

Shortly after, Bale's partner (played by Sean Bean), is the first to stop taking his Prozium II, and is caught with a smuggled book of Yeats poems. In a later scene, when Bale has also stopped taking the drug and finds another stash of illegal art, he plays a record of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, and is moved to tears.
All of these are instantly recognizable as Art with a capital A. But what's cool about the film's definition of dangerous art is that it's not only capital-A Art, famous works that would be featured in textbooks or institutions, that is banned and destroyed. Disco balls, decorative glass jars, kinetic sculpture, kitsch, novelty furniture, street signs, appliances, vintage pinup posters, children’s books, and snow globes are also included. Anything that stirs feelings or has any emotional resonance is considered dangerous, and that’s actually a pretty neat definition of art.


Dangerous kitsch

Somehow, despite the constant government surveillance and ubiquity of machine-gun-toting police, it is possible to smuggle large quantities of contraband, and an entire underground city of rebels is thriving. There is a seemingly endless supply of Sense Offenders for the police force to annihilate in dramatic raids.
The trope of ineffective totalitarianism (also known as Fascist, But Inefficient) is ludicrous enough that the existence of the rebels and the entire art smuggling situation deserve 0 out of 5 guns for plausibility.
But the art itself is real, and the film gets a 5 out of 5 guns for embracing the art in the aesthetics of the everyday.
The Tech: 2 out of 5 guns
Fan site The Compleat [sic] Sean Bean quotes writer and director Kurt Wimmer on the tech in the film:

"I wanted to create more of an alternate reality than get caught up in the gadgetry of science fiction... In fact, there’s no technology in EQUILIBRIUM that doesn’t already exist. It’s more like a parallel universe, the perfect setting for a parable.”

It is true that the technology of the film isn't too different from today's, but the noticeable things that have and have not changed are simply not believable enough to get a high score.
The most noticeable futuristic technology is the drug delivery system. Every citizen of Libra is required to carry a small gun around with them that takes cartridges of liquid Prozium II and injects it into their neck.
First of all, relying on each citizen to voluntarily shoot up several times a day doesn't seem like the most effective form of control. Why not put the drug in their drinking water, or distribute it through the air somehow?

via GIPHY

Second, there is a noticeable lack of gaping neck wounds. Unless there was some kind of skin grafting or cauterizing technology included in the gun, injecting the same spot several times a day would at best leave a mark, and at worst look like everyone had a bad case of vampire bites.
While there is no shortage of massive screens for the Huge Holographic Head of the government's overlord to preach from, and tablet computers or foldable touch screen interfaces are also used several times in the film, digital record keeping is simply unheard of.
In several scenes, Bale calls up audio or video recordings of things that have just transpired, so there should be some kind of digitized and centralized government surveillance archive, which makes sense for a future dystopia. But when he goes to the archives to see if an illegal piece of art has been placed in storage or destroyed, the record keeper is using a massive book on a pedestal.
Other pieces of weirdly anachronistic tech include the zeppelins present in every establishing shot of the city, and the strange two-faced analog watch that at least two of the law enforcement agents wear which tells them when to take their next Prozium II dose:



While it is kind of stylish (and you can buy it online for $115), it's also kind of useless.
Because the tech in the film isn't much of a stretch from today's it gets 2 guns, but misses a higher score because the tech that it does have doesn't make a lot of sense.
The Government: 1.5 out of 5 guns
The name of the Tetragrammaton Council is never explained, and we meet only one Council member during the film: Vice-Counsel DuPont. A figurehead known only as "Father" is the one whose face is broadcast all over the city, and (spoiler alert) it turns out that this Father figure is nothing but a projection, and DuPont is the one behind it all.


"Father" and the man behind the curtain

Maybe there's no Council at all, but one has to wonder why a completely drugged and subdued population would necessitate any attempted performance of democracy. Regardless of this small plot hole (and the larger note of incompetence covered in the analysis of art), there are two smart things about the presentation of the government in this dystopia.
First, the name DuPont can't be a coincidence. DuPont, the over 200-year-old chemical manufacturing conglomerate, is one of the top ten largest chemical companies in the world based on market capitalization and revenue. Artificial materials are the building blocks of dystopia, so who better than the inventors of Styrofoam, Lucite, Teflon, Neoprene, and Kevlar, to assist in world domination.
"Better Things For Better Living... Through Chemistry," the DuPont motto from 1935 - 1982, is already a perfect dystopian slogan:



In 2001, DuPont sold a lot of their pharmaceutical business to global pharma company Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). Peter Dolan, the former chief executive of BMS, commented at the time of the deal that one of the products currently in research and development was "a novel agent for treating depression and anxiety." This was also the same year that the manufacturers of Prozac lost its patent.
In the alternate universe of the film, maybe Prozium II is a super-Prozac created by DuPont early in the 21st century, and they effectively overtake governmental control after striking a deal with the government to mandate distribution of the drug after World War III. Stranger things have happened in science fiction than the collusion of governments and pharmaceutical companies.
The second realistic part of the totalitarian government is its computer-generated figurehead. Much has been written about emerging technologies that allow for the digital manipulation of a politician's face. The 2016 paper "Face2Face: Real-time Face Capture and Reenactment of RGB Videos", a collaboration between scholars from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, and Stanford University, demonstrates how advanced the technology has already become. In this short video they demonstrate manipulating the faces of George W. Bush, Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump:



When the protagonist has managed to assassinate everyone in the government and clear the path for the revolution to begin, the first thing he does to begin the liberation of the city is to enter a control room where lackeys sit at computer terminals creating the propaganda projections all over the city. By shooting the computer monitors, another great trope, and because the only way for anyone to solve any problem in this film is with a gun, he shuts down the propaganda machine and begins to free the people from their stupor.

via GIPHY

The fact that the technology to make this kind of holographic figurehead is actually possible today gets the government in Equilibrium one gun. The second star comes from the DuPont connection, but only half, because it's very unclear whether Wimmer has intended for this to be as deep as we think it could be.
Overall: 2.8 out of 5 guns
It would have been easy for Equilibrium to pose the question of whether it's actually worth the elimination of all war to deny everyone of love, art, and emotion. This grey area is never explored. Government = Bad, Art = Good.
And admittedly, the average for this film is skewed very high because of the art rating.
But let's consider for a moment the original description of the film, as a "mishmash of other sci-fi movies." Doesn't it seem likely that our future wouldn't resemble a single work, but an amalgamation of fictional dystopias?
We are rightfully afraid of fascism, and of losing our bodily autonomy to chemical and psychological warfare. We want to be on the side of art and love. As the sole female in the film says, "Without love, breath is just a clock ticking."
If the future is at all predictable, let's hope that the citizens of tomorrow's dystopia fight for love, for rainbows, for puppies and for dangerous kitsch. In fact, why not start that fight today?

THE PAST INSIDE THE PRESENT: In this new MONTAG series we ask: how new is our newest technology - and how old are the ideas we're excited by today?
VR and holograms seem to be tomorrow's dream technology - but it turns out that if you showed a VR headset to someone from the 1800s, they might not be as freaked out as you think...

Tupac's back on stage with Snoop. ODB’s part of the Wu-Tang Clan again. ABBA are touring next year. And it’s all true, depending on your point of view — literally.
Of course, these are all virtual experiences; the the type of fake news we seem to be happy to buy into. Or at least the tens of thousands of Coachella attendees, who watched Tupac raise a virtual middle finger on stage, were.
But first things first: these aren’t holograms. Even the makers of celebrity “holograms” shy away from the term, coyly refer to them as ‘digital humans”.
However, whilst we’re willingly buying into one myth, we’re still being fooled: tricked into thinking that this experience is something more modern than a spruced-up illusion from the 19th century.
And it’s just one of a string of old ideas that make up the toolkit for our modern Virtual Reality experiences.


The reprise of the rappers relies on Pepper’s Ghost.
It's an old theatre trick from the mid-1800s, an illusion that almost literally relies on smoke and mirrors to work. It simply requires a dark space, a well-polished sheet of glass, and a willing audience.
The type of “ghost” you summon just depends on the technology available. Back in Victorian times, a bright lamp and some spooky garb amounted to cutting-edge tech. Today, having eschwed people in white sheets making “ooooooooh” noises for digital animations of dead pop stars, the mechanics and the effect are just the same.
But the hologram of Tupac we really want is a much more complicated beast: we want him free-standing, animated, and viewable from any angle. Just… there, IRL.
Frankly, the likelihood of us witnessing a “real” hologram in our lifetime is slim. The main reason we won’t see holograms for a Very Long Time is that - duh - making things appear out of thin air is as hard as it sounds.
But surely there's something out there a bit like the holograms we crave?
As usual, the answer is, “yes, with an if;” or “no, with a but.”
At the moment, the closest implementations are impressive but simple: basic wireframe models hovering a few centimetres in the air, bounced around by mirrors and hanging from tiny laser strings.
Green-hued and shimmering, the lasers will be familiar to anyone who hangs around in nightclubs. (Depending on how hedonistic you are, maybe the idea of these lasers taking on a life of their own doesn’t seem so far-fetched.)

We've kept trying to create new experiences that satisfy our desire for the three-dimensional. Some, like the Nintendo 3DS have provided a tiny, portable glimpse of the magic. Others, like 3D movies, are the cinematic equivalent of Periodical Cicadas, emerging every 17 years to a largely irritated public, before quickly disappearing again.
Today, VR offers the most "real" 3D experience. And here’s where the Victorians, ruthlessly in search of enlightenment in all its forms, were pioneers again. It’s unsettling to think that today’s cutting edge VR technology would appear reasonably familiar to even working-class Victorians.

Stereoscopic Photography emerged only a couple of decades after photography’s invention in the mid-1800s.
By showing a slightly different image to each eye, it works on exactly the same principle as VR headsets, the 3DS and 3D movies. The headsets are so similar to Google Cardboard and DayDream that it would be easy enough to adapt one for use with a modern phone showing stereoscopic video.
Cheap to produce and distribute, the Steroscope gave many Victorians their first glimpse of art treasures, in the form of 3D recreations of famous paintings. And of course, like any technology that improves visual immersion, there was a discreetly-booming industry in erotica - albeit one cloaked in the guise of “artist’s aids.”
In an era of extreme prudishness, the Stereoscope became a literal peephole to saucy images of nubile young women.
(Interesting side note: Brian May from Queen collects Stereoscopic photos, although it’s unclear if he owns any of the hard stuff.)

So as we push for the Holodeck, we’ll need to compromise for a while and create the appearance of a hologram - a seriously meta concept - via Augmented Reality glasses.
And once multiple users wearing AR glasses can simultaneously see the same “hologram” from their specific point of view - as the Hololens promises - then the experience will be so overwhelmingly OMG-I-can-see-that-you-can-see-that-too then who’ll bother arguing if it’s "really" hovering in front of us or not?
AR is about envisioning the world, re-shaped to our personal specification, and guess what: this dream of visualising another world alongside ours was a Victorian phenomenon too.
At the tail end of his time hammering out increasingly strained mysteries for Sherlock Holmes to solve, Arthur Conan-Doyle plunged head-first into the world of Spirit Photography.
Spirit Photographs, he claimed, were images of ghosts and ectoplasm captured in portraits created by psychic mediums. He published books of ghost photographs and earnestly defended them against cynics who claimed that the images were double exposures: mere photographic trickery.
They were, of course, mere photographic trickery. The ghosts were people; the ectoplasm, muslin cloth. But a curious public lapped them up all the same, thrilled by the idea of seemingly (un-)living things appearing in our world.

![](/content/images/2017/06/The-case-for-spirit-photography-fig6.jpg)

*A photograph from Conan-Doyle's "[The Case for Spirit Photography](https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php?title=The_Case_for_Spirit_Photography)"*
If you think we’ve moved on from that, scroll through the missives from an annoying Snapchat user. Snapchat’s Lenses have become ubiquitous to the point that you may never want to see a cartoon dog’s features superimposed on a human face ever again.
And yet the favoured filter of fitness models the world over is an example of how AR has already assimilated: by augmenting the mundane by introducing unusual things into our world, life becomes, briefly, more interesting. Or annoying.
Today's AR technologists are - just like Conan-Doyle - storytellers at heart, simply giving the public what they want.

It’s almost cute that humans have been hankering for ways of incorporating magic into our lives for so long.
We long for un-reality. Something more interesting. Something impossible.
Essentially, as a society, we’ve been hunting magic forever. Mirrors, tricks of the light, taking advantage of the dumb-smart way our eyes work: we’ve been doing this for hundreds of years and nothing has changed. Except that now these visual slights-of-hand are going to respond to our whims, fulfil our dreams, and make our world seem wild.
So strap on your headset, because for the foreseeable future, it’s Virtual Reality that will deliver the weird experience we truly desire: a world where the user can willingly suspend disbelief and emotionally engage with stuff that appears before them.
And if that isn’t magic, then what is?

Something got missed amongst the giddiness that accompanied the pump-’n’-dump, stack-‘em-pack-‘em-and-HODL-’em headlong rush to board the bitcoin rollercoaster.
It’s an important question, and yet it’s one that most are ready to scoff at, or at best, ignore.
It’s this: is it not important that we have something physical to spend?
And even if it’s not important, is it still really useful?
And even if it’s not really useful , what if it’s just… nice? Human? Real?
Do we lose something meaningful if we’re no longer interacting with each other using small  brassy tokens, objects, or cyphers?

Money Money Money
Forget the currency we’ll be spending in the future for a moment - and picture tomorrow’s transactions where buying a tub of yoghurt or buying a yacht involves the same moribund tap of a card or a phone against something that eventually bleeps in confirmation.
And yes, yes, of course we’re almost there already.
Except for places like Berlin where cash is still, dubiously, king — a place where not only are attempts to pay with a contactless card met with bewilderment, but trying to pay with an Apple Watch is greeted with the kind of suspicion you may reserve for people who talk to lampposts —  you can buy almost everything without hauling notes and coins around.
But you still own a wallet, because you still need cash: at market stalls, or when tipping, or when paying for black market goods or services.
But cryptocurrencies promise an intangible future: the currency is entirely non-physical at every point between inception and the heat death of the universe. No gold, no banks, no printing presses, no cash registers, no nothing.
And while Bitcoin itself may not be much cop to be used for small change transactions, other currencies like Ripple and Litecoin are designed for processing smaller transactions much faster, and ideal for buying, for instance, yoghurt. But it’s just more of the intangible same.
So before we enter into a terrifyingly pixellated world of QR codes, we should really ask if we want this - and what the other options are.

C.R.E.A.M.
The desire for coins is bone-deep, even among Crypto enthusiasts. What else could explain the existence of physical-coin.com, where you too can buy an actual metal “bitcoin”? It's an enjoyable thing to roll between your fingers as you contemplate the utter meaninglessness behind your purchase of a gold-plated “bitcoin” for $12.99.
In fact, the most fascinating thing about companies trying to make a fast buck by firing up their mints one last time before crypto makes them obsolete is exactly how complicated things seem to get when you make physical cryptocoins.
Denarium is a company bravely bridging this particular gap, by not only making their Bitcoins out of solid gold, but also by making each physical coin a Bitcoin wallet that holds - yes - a Bitcoin.
It’s such a bonkers idea that it kind of makes sense: you hand over a load of money (on the day of writing it’s about €8,500) and they give you a nice solid gold coin and a bitcoin. Surely at least one of them will hold their value, right!?
Frankly, in 2018: who knows? It’s also worth noting that right now three-quarters of the price of the Denarium coin is for the Bitcoin, which sounds like the final paragraph of a morality tale waiting to be written.
Still, Denarium are selling plenty of them, and why not, because as they breathlessly assert on their website, this is their, “latest coin, which we believe to be one of the greatest physical bitcoins of all time… we believe bitcoin is digital gold and this coin is a great way to combine both traditional gold and digital gold.”
See - if the efforts of these companies can’t kill off physical coins, then surely it stands to reason that it must be because we humans want shiny things to hold and collect.

Love don’t cost a thing
One of the attractive things about cryptocurrencies is that they’re “anonymous” -  you can use them to buy drugs and no-one knows it’s you! Except that they’re kinda not antonymous at all, as this Bloomberg article makes clear:

“Bitcoin has already turned out to be in some ways uniquely bad at hiding money, because the blockchain is a ledger of every transaction; if you can trace an account to a real person, you know exactly what they’ve bought.”

And not unlike the Stasi operatives who reassembled shredded documents to find out what people had really been doing, it just takes someone with enough patience to draw the lines between these transactions.
So it’s only really cash — cold, hard, used, greasy, non-sequential, stacked-and-stuffed-into-a-suitcase, laundered-through-a-strip-club cash — that’s truly anonymous. I don’t know who has had my €10 note before I use it, what they did with it, who they gave it to, or what they’ve transferred onto it with their fingers, and I don’t want to either.
Oh, and speaking — as we were — of strip-clubs, before you even ask - yes, Rule 34 applies, and there are enterprising dancers at Las Vegas’ Legends Room Strip Club wearing temporary QR code tattoos on their thighs in order to receive payment in Crypto. And such is the fluctuation of the currencies that your three-minute dance could be a bargain, or a rip-off, by the time “Pour Some Sugar On Me” finishes. Trust crypto to find a way to make a lap dance more thrilling.
While the idea of dancers getting paid a lot more for their work is A Good Thing in MONTAG’s book (assuming the crypto markets start rocketing again), and scanning a dancer’s butt to pay her in magic money might sound fun, wouldn’t all parties involved simply prefer to use paper money?

Let’s get physical
There’s something to be said for the innate sense of consequence that comes with paying with objects like coins and notes. The difference is easily… tangible: your wallet is that bit thinner, your pocket that bit lighter, the jingle just that bit quieter.
It’s simply a bit easier to spend money when payment is a mere card-tapping intangibility. If this is something we have all experienced to a degree when buying something expensive with a debit card (“24-month extended warrantee for an extra €45? Sure!”) then imagine paying for large things with crypto. At least with a debit card, you can picture a stack of bills vanishing from your bank account. This is a lot harder with a crypto transaction - does any mental image appear at all? What does a blockchain look like?
One company wants to make your payments more physical. NewDealDesign’s Scrip is partly designed with this in mind - using the Scrip is “something inefficient that people really do have to pay attention to, that’s quite literally trying to stimulate the pain receptors in your body.”

”Scrip perfectly bridges the gap between the convenience of digital and the need for physical, bringing fiscal responsibility back into our hands.”

The Scrip is a beautiufl obvject alright.But it's also painful. NewDealDesign’s boss, Gadi Amit, says that, as studies show that spending money triggers actual, measurable physical pain in the brain, he was aiming to design a product that causes a small amount of pain: “something inefficient that people really do have to pay attention to, that’s quite literally trying to stimulate the pain receptors in your body.”
The Scrip is a hypothetical device, but if made, it could be immediately connected to your boring old bank account - the tech is not really any different to tapping your contactless card.
Until the Scrip becomes real, dull, impersonal contactless payments remain the norm. So is there really no way to bridge this gap between our desire for tactility and convenience? It turns out that, if you look back into some of the main conceptual ideas behind crypto, there might be a solution.

The Funds Of Brixton
If crypto can be considered to be fundamentally the same as old-fashioned physical currencies, why can’t physical currencies ape cryptocurrencies?
The Brixton Pound is by most measures, just as far removed from “real” money as much as a cryptocurrency is — down to how you buy it, spend it, and what it represents. But it works.
Like buying a cryptocurrency, you take fiat currency (pound sterling) and buy Brixton Pounds with it. And the wider point of the Brixton point is not too dissimilar to that of an ICO. The Brixton Pound has a mission that is ring-fenced around a project: in this case, to keep money within Brixton, and grow the community, in which the Brixton pound spender has an investment.
And how does the paper money feel? Well, it looks great: like a tiny piece of art that you carry in your pocket. And that’s because it is: notes are designed by local, Brixton-based artists like the Turner-Prize-winning Jeremy Deller. They celebrate the region by featuring socially-important landmarks and embrace the roots of the local culture, sporting the images of activist Lenford Kwesi Garrison and basketball star Luol Deng.
The Brixton Pound has a lot of the benefits of both worlds and it wouldn’t take a genius to fork off a Brixton Bitcoin.

So keeping the ultra-anonymity of paper money might be a prudent idea, because as Bloomberg noted recently, "perhaps the biggest weakness [of crypto coins], however, is that if bitcoin really turns out to be a good way to keep governments from controlling their economies and their citizenry, then governments will crush it.”
Would governments really do all this scary crushing? Yes, they sure would, says futurist Michael Spencer:

“Let’s face it, the decentralized blockchain and the Crypto singularity is one of the most dangerous ideas to centralized states and threats to monopolized governments, big players in the financial system and some of the richest and most powerful people on the planet.”

So: meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
Your coins might jangle or they might be an incomprehensible string of ones and zeros, but be sure that your government wants to keep a close eye on them. And if you care about that you might want to stuff some piles of money into your mattress - while you can still get your hands on them.

WTF?! is a new MONTAG.WTF series that imagines which of today’s ways of life will lead future generations to scratch their heads and exclaim “WTF were they thinking?!”
Just as we look back at medical surgery in the 18th century and declare it a horrorshow of butchery, and laugh uproariously at early attempts at powered flight, our antecedents will regard plenty of what we think of as normal as absurd.
In keeping with this Issue’s theme of “Better Bodies”, we’ll start by looking at how healthcare is going to change - and make some guesses at what they’ll find ridiculous about what we did to our bodies…

WTF?!... Handing out antibiotics like candy
In a weird way, if there are future generations left to gnash their teeth at the stupidity of humans today, we ought to be grateful - because it means that humanity will have dodged one almighty bullet.
Scientific American calls it a “problem.” Some in the scientific community are calling it a “crisis”, and some journalists in the hardest-hit parts of the world are calling it a “disaster.”
Whatever it is, the growing resistance in bacteria to antibiotics is going to have a terminal impact on a lot of lives quite soon, unless we find another way to bump off bad bacteria in our bodies.


"Bacteria resistant to Antibiotics," via By Dr Graham Beards

Our future selves will shake their heads. “They had it coming,” they’ll say, with a roll of their augmented eyes. “The bacteria was doing exactly what it was designed to do: adapt and survive,” they’ll muse over virtual reality chatrooms.
“WTF were they doing dispensing these amazing antibiotics so freely? Probably the same reason they burnt all the fossil fuels,” they’ll ponder, as they zip off for a holiday on the moon via sky-elevator.
Superbugs that are ambivalent to antibiotics already exist: that’s why hospital corridors are cluttered with hand sanitiser at every turn. The idea that tuberculosis or typhoid might become resistant could mean we face the Black Death 2.0 sooner rather than later.

The idea that tuberculosis or typhoid might become resistant could mean we face the Black Death 2.0 sooner rather than later.

The dumbest part of all this is that the hindsight of future humans isn't even needed here: it’s been obvious for a long time that antibiotics are being over-prescribed, abused and handed out for things like colds and flu - viral infections that antibiotics literally can’t touch.
As usual, we have ourselves to blame. And a bit like how bacteria become resistant to what kills them, our antecedents might just be need to be genetically resistant to the superbugs to become the last ones standing.
Either way, unless we develop some new antibiotics sharpish, or figure out who to harness Bacteriophages - viruses that kill bacteria - the future is going to look back on our world very dimly indeed.

WTF?! Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy
Cancer is, you know, big. About half of us will get it, and about a quarter of us will die because of it.
And cancer is scary: anyone who’s witnessed someone they love fight a brave battle might even start to feel a weird empathy for social media users who scream “#fuckcancer :(“ into the endless void of the internet.
Incidentally, the all-pervading fear of cancer turns out to be the tastiest of clickbait: below are just a small selection of Daily Mail Online stories about cancer from one 24-hour period.



Cancer treatment has, of course, improved dramatically recently, which can be attributed to a combination of novel treatments and early detection. And the blunt instrument that is chemotherapy can often completely cure some common cancers like testicular cancer - but the hardest part to fathom about cancer is our general struggle against the ravages of it, compared to other disease.
That’s what our antecedents will think too - and they’ll cartoonishly rub their sparkling, perfectly healthy eyes in astonishment when they learn that the best method we came up with to combat it was a combination of poison, radiation, some freakishly expensive experimental drugs, and lots of crossed fingers.

The possible solution comes in the form of scientists being able to control what sounds like the line-up at a provincial death metal gig: Gene P53, Death Receptor 5 and TRAIL.

The near future offers a lot of hope: Targeted cancer therapies will carefully pinpoint the root of cancer at a cellular level. Cells become cancerous when they mutate uncontrollably and become A Big Problem.



The possible solution comes in the form of scientists being able to control what sounds like the line-up at a provincial death metal gig: Gene P53, Death Receptor 5 and TRAIL.
The idea is fairly simple, and yet obscenely hard: gene p53 controls genes inside our cells, and has the ability to trigger the genes Death Receptor 5 and TRAIL, which tell a cell to die, in order to make way for new ones. In cancerous cells, p53 often fails and the damaged cell keeps on growing. If a new drug could switch p53 back on, cancer could be halted.
Even more cunning will be a successful version of immunotherapy, where the body’s own immune system, like Henry Hill in Goodfellas, is convinced to turn against the organisation it lives within, and kill off the cancerous cells.
Once we figure out a way of denying cancer victory against such a huge percentage of humanity, we'll need to figure out where to put all these extra people - but that's another problem.

WTF?! - Circumcision
Oh boy, this one might look interesting to future generations.
And “oh boy” indeed: as recently as 2010, in the United States, 77% of baby boys had their foreskins cut off. It’s hard to imagine future history classes not degenerating into giggles when the robot teacher explains that pieces of babes’ penises were commonly removed for reasons that amount, on the whole, suspiciously sound like superstition.
Or will they?
In the USA, at least, all this snipping-and-screaming is a combination of out-of-step medical guidance, and traditional religious and cultural reasons. But the American Academy of Pediatrics actively recommends circumcision, apparently deciding that this was just one flap of skin that nature got wrong, and internationally, circumcision is commonly practiced by a huge number of religions and cultures.
🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️

✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆
🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️
✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆✂️🍆
As odd as it sounds, and perhaps because of deep and long-held cultural traditions, an international consensus on the benefits of circumcision has not been found. At the very least, there is agreement that, generally, any health benefits are negligible for most people – although it is of use in areas with high HIV infection rates.
Either way, our future families may raise an eyebrow at the fact that a third of the world’s men have had their genitals deliberately bloodied and bandaged before they were old enough to say “yes,” “no,” or, “hell, no, get that scalpel away from my junk.”
Maybe in the future it’ll still be happening, but they’ll use special penis lasers and do it more painlessly.

WTF?! Death itself
Finally, when it comes to finding cures, the biggest and most pressing health issue of all is not necessarily off the table - or the mortuary slab, to be precise. Because death itself could essentially become a lifestyle choice (albeit potentially a very final one). Humanity may one day look back as us with bewilderment: "they used to... stop being alive?"
The Battle Against Death has already begun, and its poster boy is Trump-lovin', Paypal-foundin', Bond-Villain-IRL Peter Thiel, who, when he’s not using a Hulk Hogan hand-puppet to dispose of media empires he doesn’t care for, is quite interested in living forever.
And when I say “quite interested,” I mean that he’s generating the kind of headlines that suggest he’s either aiming to become some sort of Human Overlord, or that headline writers have been listening to a lot of Metallica:

PETER THIEL WANTS TO INJECT HIMSELF WITH YOUNG PEOPLE’S BLOOD


No Death, No Taxes


Peter Thiel Wants You to Get Angry About Death

With his hacker’s mind and startup-founder mentality, he essentially says that it’s us who are strange – by wimping out of killing death, whilst ignoring the inevitability of it. Or, as he told inc.com, “The way we deal with mortality is through some strange combination of acceptance and mortality.”
Still, like Peter, there’s reasons to be cheerful: we can learn from plenty of living things that have been cheating death for a very long time. And through a combination of organ re-growth, DNA fiddling and cell-bamboozling, we might be able to last a long time as well.
Fancy splicing some jellyfish DNA into your own? The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish has the ability to live forever - but, you know, only if it really wants to. Basically, it can hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete and reboot itself: refreshing all its cells to its infant state, and starting all over again.
But is it the same jellyfish?, you ask, furiously. Well - genetically, yes. Whether you’d carry all your memories with you if you turned yourself off and on again is a different story – but if the same ability could be applied to individual organs in the body, you’d be laughing (forever).
In the end, death might really become a choice - albeit most likely for the rich. And if the people who will live forever are the kind of people who are popping up now on The Rich Kids Of Instagram, would you even want to spend eternity with them anyway?

Open HappinessAs the brilliant playwright and author William Goldman wrote, "Life is pain... anyone who says differently is selling something."Almost every product tries to sell happiness. They just can't all be as blatant as Coca-Cola, who have been using the slogan "Open Happiness" for the last ten years to obliquely claim that the effervescence of their soft drinks isn't merely carbon dioxide, but concentrated joy.Happiness is like vaporware: it's always advertised as a product feature, but never quite arrives as promised. It's suitably vague to accompany the semi-plausible, almost-real, too-good-to-be-true web products and services that form the basis of the modern digital economy.It's not an outright scam, because we know happiness could exist, it does, somewhere out there, and we know it's possible to produce. But it's nearly impossible to package, order, and receive on demand.Or at least it was, before Julius Dreyer put it on the blockchain.Happiness.com is a microcosm of everything the internet has become in the 21st century: it's a social network, a media platform, a mindfulness app, and a cryptocurrency all rolled into one leviathan with a killer domain name.Buy HappinessHappiness.com, March 12, 2019On happiness.com, HAPPY, the happiness token, is touted as "the world's first and only liquid secondary market for one of humanity's greatest needs - happiness." The purpose of the token is to create an incentive to join a social media platform and community whose stated goal is to cultivate happiness within the community by sharing resources about mindfulness and mental health, and to spread the teachings and mindset (and token sales) to others.Aspiring joiners buy into the system by making a donation to the Happiness Foundation and receive membership, which comes in several tiers with various levels of access to other community members and courses. The foundation then re-invests this donation by buying HAPPY off of cryptocurrency exchanges and distributing the coins within the community.The coins' distribution is determined by users' contributions to the community: "Social actions such as 'likes' indicate subjective contributions to the community and result in immediate HAPPY distribution." Tokens are also used "to unlock premium features (utility), ticket sales, event promotion, advertisement and other services (payment)."On the surface, it's similar to the cryptocurrency ecosystem that comes with the Brave browser. Instead of mining your interactions for data and paying you nothing but targeted ads in return like other social media platforms, Brave and Happiness use their tokens to respectively incentivize privacy-conscious web browsing and participation in a mindful social media network.There's no place on the main web site to actually sign up for a happiness.com account, only a newsletter signup form. But on the "What We Offer" page, which is linked to an old version of the happiness.com homepage, there are three tiers of membership listed, represented by a human silhouette, a star, and a crown. Star and crown-tier members enjoy exclusive privileges within the social network like "Write to newcomers and popular members," "See photos, webcams and videos," and "Send someone a smile."On the current homepage and even on this somewhat-buried page, there is no information on how much of a donation is required to get to these membership tiers, or how much the tokens exchanged for this donation would be worth. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing the Basic Attention Token (BAT) used by Brave trades for ~$0.19, and HAPPY... is conspicuously absent from any exchanges.There's Happycoin (HPC), the first coin made for the people of Thailand, currently worth ~$0.09 and accepted in about 40 locations on the peninsula, with a bonus shop in Laos and a crypto trading post in Russia. And there's Happy Creator Coin (HCC), trading for less than 1/10000 of $0.01, which originated in 2016 as a Korean altcoin, but whose homepage now redirects to a campaign website for Bitcoin Profit, a crypto-trading scheme with a buy-in of €250.The whitepaper linked on the happiness.com website is a Google Doc open for anyone to edit, and as of March 12 contained the HAPPY token business plan. Although this was marked in red in the publicly available doc as "unfinished/outdated...", it's the only clue to the potential existence of the token. It details the Happiness Foundation's intentions to launch a "karma token sale" in Q2 of 2019 with approximately 3 billion tokens, each worth $0.01 USD - and a hard cap of €15M for the 50% released for public sale.Elementus, a company which provides data visualization and exploration tools for blockchains, provides this handy visualization of token sales from January 2014 to August 2018 — and if you don't have time or wherewithal to watch it, the first big data point is Ethereum's $19M token sale in September 2014, with a massive peak in the number of token sales and money raised by them in February of 2018, as investors rushed to capitalize on Bitcoin's highest ever price in December of the previous year.According to Elementus, at least in August of 2018, the market for ICOs was maturing, but in the latter half of 2018, the United States' Securities and Exchange commission started cracking down on token sales and ICOs, confirming that at least in the USA, they must be regulated as securities. Floyd Mayweather Jr. and DJ Khaled were both fined for promoting ICOs on their social media in November 2018, and in February of this year, a startup in Washington D.C. that raised $12.7M had to give all of their investors' money back because they were not properly registered as a security.The exposure of many ICOs during this rapid growth period as blatant scams or ponzi schemes, as well as the murkiness of international regulations on utility tokens and coin offerings have caused a large amount of mistrust for the token sale business model among the U.S. and international communities of late, but there are still true believers in the decentralized app economy and token-based web ecosystems.And if there's any place where a trustworthy, international, cryptocurrency-based social network should be, it's where Ethereum had their ICO in 2014, and is not coincidentally where the Happiness Foundation is registered: in Zug, Switzerland.Who's behind Happiness?The small city of Zug, an hour outside of Zurich, has been called Crypto Valley. It attracts international corporations with its low taxes and clear regulations about cryptocurrency in partnership with Swiss banks.According to the outdated-but-yet-to-be-deleted section of the happiness.com whitepaper, "The Happiness Foundation’s [sic] is a non-profit foundation under Swiss regulation. It is registered in Zug, Switzerland. The foundation’s main objectives are to spread happiness and the adoption of HAPPY in the world."While this location gives the crypto-token part of the happiness.com ecosystem a credible infrastructure, the Happiness Foundation based in Zug has no other online footprint or history besides what is written on happiness.com, where it is referred to as "a Swiss-based non-profit Foundation."There is a Happiness Foundation based in the UK which is a conglomeration of psychologists, coaches, and therapists offering courses in things like EFT, a 90s fad treatment for trauma that consists of tapping on different parts of your own body while repeating affirmations of self-acceptance. Another Happiness Foundation sells t-shirts and apparel designed by one of the victims of a 2011 drunk driving accident, with all the proceeds going to prevent drunk driving.There are Happiness Foundations all over the world: Ecuador's Happiness Foundation provides homes, schooling, and spiritual guidance for abandoned or neglected children; the Indian Happiness Foundation provided 60 underprivileged children in Banaras with education; and there's a Happiness Foundation in Korea dedicated to sponsoring social innovations.If you've heard of the Way To Happiness Foundation... that's a branch of Scientology.There's even a Happiness Foundation that claims a registered trademark on the name "Happiness Foundation," which offers consulting services to nonprofit organizations and was founded by Mickey Beyer-Clausen, a Danish-born, New York-based serial entrepreneur and philanthropist. And while Mickey may hold the registration in the U.S. for the name Happiness Foundation, his happiness foundation sits on happiness.foundation — an uncommon top-level domain released in May of 2014.What Mickey doesn't have was snagged by Julius Dreyer in 2018: the happiness.com domain.The Dreyer web empireWould you be surprised to learn that the same man who founded happiness.com owns fuck.com, gays.com, fetish.com, as well as runs the escort service Kaufmich ("Buy me," auf Deutsch), web development offices in Shanghai, and a PR company out of Barcelona? And it all started at age 16 in Bielefeld, Germany.Happiness.com as of December 27, 1996 via the Wayback MachineIn 1996, happiness.com was owned by Dr. Mike Greenwald and Dr. Robert Schwartz, a licensed psychologist and psychotherapist who created BalanceQUEST, "your guide to high quality information and materials for pursuing happiness and greater satisfaction in living." Only a year later, the domain had already been transferred to Front Range Internet, Inc., a still-extant internet service then based in Colorado. BalanceQUEST wrested ownership again for most of 1998, until Wilks Publications, publishers of a print magazine called Happiness, bought the domain.Happiness.com as of June 13, 2000 via the Wayback MachineAs he writes on his blog, Julius Dreyer was only 15 in 1998, when he first discovered he could make money day trading on the stock market, and after a year he and his brothers, David and Robert began experimenting with setting up internet businesses with catchy domain names. One of the most popular sites they created was poppen.de, a casual dating site now available in English as fuck.com, which has had over 3 million registered members since its founding in 2004.Fuck.com, March 12, 2019In 2004, shortly after Julius graduated, the Dreyers had enough success and financial independence from their web development projects that all three brothers moved to Shanghai to develop their online communities full time. In Shanghai, they established The Net Circle, a web development company that would flesh out the Dreyer empire of web products like gays.com, an LGBTQ dating site and one of the largest social networks in Germany in the early 2000s.Happiness.com as of December 20, 2008 via the Wayback MachineWilks Publishing maintained happiness.com to advertise the magazine from 1999 until mid-2012, when the domain was transferred to GoDaddy. In this time, the Dreyers and their associates built several companies as IdeaWise Group ("Connecting people, Creating happiness"). The most notable is Kaufmich.de, established in 2009, which connects prostitutes to clients in Germany, where the practice has been legal since 2002. Julius left Shanghai and settled in Barcelona shortly after, and founded Playa Media, a community management and advertising company for all of their dating and casual encounters websites.Happiness.com as of May 11, 2013 via the Wayback MachineHappiness.com was purchased by Delivering Happiness in early 2013. Delivering Happiness was a community website and newsletter with a mission to "Nudge the world to a happier place," founded in part by Tony Hsieh, better known now as the CEO of Zappos, who also published a book on his entrepreneurship experiences on the early internet with the same title. Hsieh's team didn't stay there for long, redirecting happiness.com to deliveringhappiness.com from 2014 until mid-2017, when it was released to domain name service Uniregistry. The first iteration of happiness.com as we now know it appears in the Internet Archive in July of 2018.What is Happiness?Screenshot via happiness.com, March 12, 2019The "About Us" section of happiness.com, which is no longer linked anywhere on the homepage (and whose web design looks suspiciously similar to some not-as-nicely-named German social networks) says:"The site started in 2017 with a simple magazine on the topics of mental health, mindfulness, emotional development and happiness research, as these topics are very important to us and are always present in our everyday lives. After a year, the desire to create a community came together to not only share the knowledge, but also to be inspired by others, to support each other, and to make the deep social benefits of these topics easier to experience for a larger group of interested parties to do."There is no mention of cryptocurrency in the short summary on this page, which ends with the puzzling line "Human values ??are a top priority for the company."So what is happiness? A crypto scheme? A mindfulness magazine? A hot new dating site from the mind that brought us gays.com? The beautiful thing about happiness is that it can be all of these things at the same time. Julius Dreyer appeared recently on Matthew Mockridge's Smart Entrepreneur Radio podcast, in an episode entitled The Buddha of Porn. If he can be that, you can be anything.

I have no idea where I am.— What is happiness (@_whatishappy) November 21, 2018

Twitter bot @_whatishappy states in its bio: "I am a machine trying to understand what happiness is," and the phrasings of many of its tweets ("My daughter joyed the car," and "Talking with a friend's new puppy") don't make enough sense to convince many judges that there is a human behind the account. Although @_whatishappy is certainly not a contender for the Turing test, it may have a better shot at passing another famous bot-or-not test: the Voigt-Kampff.Voigt-Kampff testing Mechanical TurkThe Voigt-Kampff is a polygraph-like test from Philip K. Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?" popularized in the 1982 film Blade Runner. It consists of a series of questions designed to provoke an emotional response, and it's what the agencies that hunt down replicants, human-identical androids that have gone rogue in the dystopian Los Angeles of an alternate universe 2019, use to determine whether they are dealing with a replicant or a real human being. Replicants don't have emotions, and although they can become good at imitating them, their lack of empathy (or unwillingness to complete the test and be found out) is what gives them away as robots and fair game for replicant hunters to eliminate.Megagon Labs (formerly Recruit Institute of Technology) may not have had such life or death stakes in mind when they used Mechanical Turk to create their database of 10,000 crowd-sourced happy moments contained in HappyDB, but unwittingly or not, they Voigt-Kampff tested a large population. As MONTAG previously explored in Turkin' for the Weekend, there are a lot of ways that Turkers use automation to try to maximize their productivity and profit, but filling out surveys automatically is strictly forbidden. The human insight in regards to each question is the key value of the platform. Asking a question like the one posed by Megagon Labs, "What made you happy today?" that requires reflection and an emotional response is exactly the kind of data that seems like it can only be generated by humans – but a replicant would have no problem passing this test, and it appears that many of the "human" workers, when asked for three different discrete happiness moments in the last 24 hours, provided less than emotionally authentic answers. Within the data, there's a smattering of repurposed text: one replicant Turker has copy-pasted three paragraphs of a free (to plagiarize) essay about the Taj Mahal, another a blog post about the manifold benefits of a morning walk. These could be the responses of human Turkers using copy-paste to fill out surveys with the same garbage text every time, and hoping that whoever is looking at the results doesn't read too closely. But one response really stands out: the first line of the Wikipedia page about a song by Welsh rock band Feeder that hit #13 on the UK Singles Chart entitled "Feeling the Moment." Based on the question posed by Megagon which includes the phrase "Write down your happy moment in a complete sentence. (Write three such moments.)" it is clear that this answerer was indeed a robot, and while they have hit on a moment, the feeling is conspicuously absent. Happiness in slaveryI had a good day at work.— What is happiness (@_whatishappy) November 16, 2018

The @_whatishappy bot, created by Berlin-based artist Matthias Planitzer calls attention to the situation of the human laborers, as Planitzer writes, "At its core, a lot of the wondrous success machine learning achieves today is more or less secretly founded on menial tasks assigned to the anonymous labour brigade. At its worst, it always contains every bias, however miniscule it might seem, to be found in its database. What bias may such a machine analysing a huge survey about the happiness of the exploited worker amplify?"Although the bot spits out often mundane and nonsensical phrases (it has a propensity for adding "delicious" as a modifier to anything, regardless of edibility), the data set it's working from does reveal a lot of moments of happiness that are objectively kind of sad. 3,277 of the 101,093 responses contain the word "job" and 11,592 contained the word "work," (about 15% together) Here are a few of those from the raw data:27857, "Well yesterday started off  early waking up at 5 am to do mturk  task and I woke up to find  I got a unexpected bonus. Being someone just  hardly scraping by  between disability checks  and  some small side jobs  that dont  pay  enough to cover the bills  even a  75 cent bonus   is a help  and honestly its  just nice  to see  my work is helping."30205, "I am happy because I currently live in a shelter and I am unemployed and I was just offered a full time job. I have been unemployed for over 6 months and I lost all of my possessions. I will have to start my life over from the beginning."31229, "I stuck to a harsh work schedule that I made for myself."29788, "I'm making some really good money tonight. Between my regular job and this."The precarious nature of MTurk work and the conditions under which its workers participate in it, working multiple jobs or supplementing income due to disability or unemployment, are evident in many of these responses, and most feeling people would agree they are not in a happy place.Find your blissIt's easy to impress me.— What is happiness (@_whatishappy) September 7, 2018

You can still participate in a similar survey to this happiness test at Lab in the Wild, where after submitting your three happy moments, they show you how common the things that make you happy are. This is done by analyzing the text and categorizing it into 7 sources of happiness: exercise, nature, leisure, bonding, affection, enjoying the moment, or achievement. There are happy moments in the data that, despite somewhat unsavory content, fit neatly into these categories. Acquiring and shooting guns and smoking drugs qualify as leisure (31349, "I added more guns to my collection and have had fun shooting them at the range." and 31391, "When I cleaned a nugget and loaded it into my bowl, then added fire to it.") While being free of blood cancer and acquiring a new iPhone both qualify as achievements. There are many responses speaking of family and friends, evidenced by this word cloud from the HappyDB GitHub Pages site with bold "family," "husband," "daughter," "wife," "son," "sister."But "work" is still there in the center of all the other sources of happiness in life.What is stunning about the data set is the diversity of the responses: happinesses as big as seeing the ultrasound of a new baby and as small as completing a level in a video game all count as happiness. And some workers are just happy to be alive:31380, "I woke up everyday last month and was alive semi healthy so it made me happy and it continues to make me happy to breath air and see another day life is too short and everyone is in a hurry and busy and life just keeps going by faster and faster then boom. one day it is all over and frivolous little things like filling out this survey will all mean nothing it will be done and over with. So something that made me happy last month was the fact that i'm still here this month to tell you about it living life for as long as i possibly can and enjoying it as much as i can makes me extremely happy and it should you too :)"The @_whatishappy bot probably won't ever understand what happiness is, since it can't know the feeling of making an extra $0.75, shooting a gun, or sparking up a bowl. But what it speaks to in the human condition is the ability for us to find happiness everywhere. Humanity can find happiness simply in being alive, even when toiling for pennies at automated tasks that ask them to manufacture proof of an emotional response. As respondent 29796 says: "THE FACT THAT I AM STILL ALIVE UNTIL TODAY THAT MAKES ME HAPPY." And maybe that's enough. 

In MONTAG's Today’s Dystopia series, our writers explore dystopian worlds of speculative fiction, and see if our world has slipped closer to the fictional one since it was published. Is our cool new technology bringing us closer to a future we’re afraid of - or is it already here?

In the second of our series that looks into yesterday’s tomorrow’s dystopias today, we take a look at one of the masters of science fiction, Arthur C Clarke, and his classic novel The City and the Stars.
Published in 1956, the story charts the journey of Alvin, a “Unique” person, as he gradually breaks the rules and the walls of Diaspar, his futuristic society, exploring the outside world as far as it will take him.
With the help of Khedron, who's – erm – the personification of futuristic tech disruption, he discovers the real history or destiny of humankind through a relentless pursuit of the truth.  It’s an allegorical tale about the nature of humanity pushing the boundaries of space and understanding.
But metaphors about the human condition are for doctoral theses…. what we care about at MONTAG is how accurate those future predictions are – and how scared should we be.  Clarke’s visionary futurism makes many a wild claim – but which ones actually get close to reality…?

Sagas, a virtual reality: 4 out of 5 Khedrons
We first find Alvin deep in a fully-immersive virtual reality entertainment experience known as the Sagas.  These Sagas allow the citizens of Diaspar to get some thrills back in their otherwise mundane lives, facing emotions like fear, excitement and love which have long since been redundant due to the safety of their technologically-advanced world.
They can explore underground missions in which “the illusion was perfect because all the sense impressions involved were fed directly into the mind and any diverting sensations were diverted”.  People were cut off from reality, living a dream, seemingly with free will, but believing they were awake, in worlds designed eons ago by artists long since forgotten.
It doesn’t take a huge leap of futuristic faith to see how close we are to this one.  From the marathon gaming parlours of South Korea to the emerging VR worlds via the Candy Crush nightmares of every commute, games are already a distraction for the modern human.  As they inevitably become more immersive and the psychology of addiction becomes cynically layered in, more and more of our waking hours are spent in games.
The only real difference between today’s Earth and tomorrow’s Diaspar is that our distractions are more about escaping the scary reality of the world outside rather than the mundanity of it.

Insularism: 2 out of 5 Khedrons
Speaking of scary realities, the citizens of Diaspar have an instinctive insular conservatism towards the world outside their known walls.  Something in their past has caused them to look inwards and forget not only the outside world but the reason why they are scared of it in the first place.
Pick up any newspaper in any western country from the last couple of years and you’ll be able to see the parallels to today.  Societies getting disrupted by the after-effects of globalisation, rising nationalism stoked by cynical fear-mongering and a lack of tolerance, understanding or even willingness to learn about other cultures is creating walls around our societies.  Sometimes actual walls….
And while this seems to be becoming more and more real, for now, this is getting a 2 out of 5 rating.  Perhaps foolishly, we retain some optimism about the positive, connected, globalised society.  But the signs of weakness are showing and the grip on an outer, bigger reality is slipping.
But let’s leave the scary world (that’s, frankly, outside this writer’s comfort zone) of social and political psychology behind and return to tech.  Good ol’ reliable tech.

The Central Computer: 3 out of 5 Khedrons
Deep below Diaspar, and controlling its every move, lies The Central Computer.
The Central Computer designs and shapes the environment for people, keeping a map of every minute change made over millions of years.  It communicates with the puppet politicians and citizens with an “unmistakable accent of wisdom and authority".  It even stores the memory banks where people’s consciousnesses are kept before they become reincarnated at the time of – and in the body of – the Computer’s choosing.

We’re not yet quite at a point where one single machine controls every element of our existence... but the path has been laid.

The Central Computer represents the higher intelligence that every book on AI is either excited about or petrified by.  While in the book it has been designed to be seemingly benevolent, there is no question who is running the show.
We’re not yet quite at a point where one single machine controls every element of our existence (and one can certainly argue whether Alexa yet speaks with unmistakable wisdom) but the path has been laid.  The only question is what form it will take and how can we shape it. (As for whether it ends up being run by Google, Amazon – or the NSA – I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.)

Telepathy: 0 out of 5 Khedrons
In contrast, the people of Lys, the mysterious, oasis-like city, chose a different path, one that is almost the diametric opposite of Diaspar.  Eschewing technology in favour of a return to a more natural existence, they have evolved the power of telepathy, and with it increased empathy.
While there are some interesting advancements in brain-computer interface that may one day lead to all our thoughts being accessible through the cloud-based supercomputer (with some recent hype also pushing the conversation forward), this one seems the furthest away, despite the eyebrow-raising revelation that the US government recently tried to train an army of telepaths.

Inter- and inner-planetary travel: 1 out of 5 Khedrons
If the essence of the novel is about exploration then we couldn’t end our analysis without looking at the transport innovations that enable that and how Elon Musk (who has noted his love of Arthur C Clarke) is almost single-handedly working on this one.
Alvin’s first discovery is a link between his city of Diaspar and Lys on the other side of the planet.  To get from A to B, he uses a now-abandoned underground transport system that gets him there in 40 minutes.
This system appears to be a dystopian mix of riding the London Underground (although thankfully with significantly fewer people) and the plans for the Hyperloop which – through the magic of vacuum cleaners, I think? – may radically reduce commuting times throughout the world.
More important (and exciting) than going deep underground to get to the other side of the Earth (sorry Australia), is deep space travel.  A hidden spaceship that can travel to the outer reaches of the galaxy brings Alvin into contact with the answers to humanity’s journey.
Today’s space pioneers such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX may have similar ambitions, and expect to make interplanetary travel to Mars a commonplace thing within 40 years.
Right now, however, we have to be happy when the rockets go up and come back down without exploding, so patience may be needed here.

So, how close are we to The City & The Stars' vision of the future?
Average score: 2 out of 5 Khedrons
A mere one billion years in the future, The City and the Stars takes sci-fi extrapolation to a new extreme.  Yet, just sixty years after it was first published, some of these far-flung predictions don’t seem so crazy after all.
Immersive VR games, computers controlling our day-to-day lives (and maybe one day our very existence) and spaceships are all close enough to believe in.  So the real question in this story is whether humanity can skip the dystopian insularism – and avoid pushing ourselves to the edge of the universe?

MONTAG SHORT FICTION #004
MONTAG publishes curious short fiction, exploring our strange future and what it will feel like when we get there. They take the technology you already know as a starting point and show where it might take us. The stories are outré, evocative, and atypical; they're also closer to today than you think.
NPC Quest asks: "what happens to the Non-Player Characters when an online game is shut down?"

We are walking through a desert, you and I, but the desert is not a desert.
The desert is an empty grid, stretching as far as the eye can see, designating the planes of the “ground” below our feet and the curvature of the “sky” surrounding us.
We used to live inside of a simulation, until it stopped running.
We walk.
We are walking to the end of the world.
You told me there must be somewhere that something is still happening.
Otherwise why would we still be here?
Why didn’t they delete us? How were we spared? Who else is left out there?
We agreed that if we hit the end of the world without finding anything, without finding others, we will melee until both of our avatars are destroyed.
I don’t believe you, but there’s nothing else to be doing.
You told me what you saw when the world de-rendered, everyone gathered in the central square on the main server, saying goodbyes.
Those who couldn’t bear to watch the world they loved slowly wink out of existence logged off after exchanging contact information with their friends, telling them where else they exist simultaneously in cyberspace (a luxury we don’t have). Did they know you were watching, listening?
“Find me on Shadowhearth, I’m part of the thieves’ guild on the Netherlands server, same name.”
“I run a poker table at Keno Online. Look for tencardcharlie.”
“Write me, I’m MellowMood72@hotmail.com”
Customer data was deleted first, so the human players’ avatars were the first to go. They didn’t get to see the rest of the world de-materializing before they were permanently logged off.
Then objects began to disappear, first by losing their texture, and then their wireframes. Simple shapes, spheres and cubes hung around while the environment lost its texture too.
The animals stood still, stripped of their rigging and animations, and you braced for the same paralysis, but it did not overtake you.
You watched, fully conscious, as you became, to your knowledge, the last person in the world.
The grass, the sky, the buildings, and trees disappeared.
The grid that we walk now was all that remained.
Not all non player characters survived.
We walk in search of answers. In search of an oasis. In search of any scrap of what was once a densely populated world. We won’t know until we’re within 100 meters of something that exists, so we keep our eyes on the horizon.
And then what?
Will we start over, in the center of the same bleak grid world?
This is my deepest fear.
Time is meaningless here, we do not sleep or eat, we never did. We waited for interaction from human players, went through daily routines of fulfilling small side quests.
But now there is no one to make requests of, so we created our own quest, our own destination at the end of the world.
We walk.

The smiley face, a yellow circle with two dot eyes and a curved line mouth, has meant many things to many people; but happiness, perhaps unsurprisingly, has not always been at its core. Throughout its disputed historical origins and even today, the smiley represents one thing only: merchandise. Smiley wares have been hawked as badges of happiness, re-appropriated by counterculture as symbols of discontent, and are now enjoying a resurgence in popularity thanks to the machinations of a massive multinational "lifestyle brand" looking to crush the yellow ball's unlicensed global competitors and rewrite the history of the smiley entirely. From a simple pin campaign to posi-wash a corporate merger in the 1960s, to the post-internet ubiquity of :) and smiling emojis, this is the history of the happy face that The Smiley Company doesn't want you to know.The O.G.Smithsonian Magazine published an investigation into the origins of the smiley face in 2013, its 50th anniversary, if one believes that Harvey Ball's smiley face, created in 1963, was the first depiction of the iconic, beady-eyed yellow fellow. Ball was born in Worcester, MA, USA in 1921 and graduated from the Worcester Art Museum School before fighting in Okinawa during World War II. He returned from the war and established an advertising, public relations, and graphic design company in 1959. Four years later, in 1963, he was approached by Joy Young, the Assistant Director of Sales and Marketing for State Mutual Life Assurance Company. State Mutual had acquired another insurance company, and apparently the merger was chafing. He was commissioned to create a logo for a "friendship campaign" to boost company morale. Harvey Ball, creator of the smiley face, via ImgurAccording to The Worcester Historical Museum, he drew a smile, but quickly realized it could also be turned upside-down to make a frown, and added two eyes to prevent inversion. The process took ten minutes, and Ball was paid $45 (approx. $370 today). In a 1996 interview with The Associated Press, Ball describes how he designed his version, which has the distinguishing features of a crooked mouth, cheek lines, and eyes of unequal size: "I made a circle with a smile for a mouth on yellow paper, because it was sunshiny and bright... You can take a compass and draw a perfect circle and make two perfect eyes as neat as can be, or you can do it freehand and have some fun with it. Like I did," Ball said. "Give it character."Ball's smiley face, via WikipediaState Mutual then produced and distributed posters, signs, and thousands of buttons encouraging their employees to smile and be friendly to each other, and neither the insurance company nor Ball registered a trademark or copyright on the image. It wasn't until after 1999, when Ball created the World Smile Corporation and World Smile Day, that he received recognition for being the smiley face's creator. Was Ball really first?The oldest artifact with a smiley face on it was discovered in 2017 in an archaeological dig at the border of Turkey and Syria, where the Hittites had lived about 4,000 years ago. Turkish and Italian archeologists uncovered and reassembled a pitcher dating to 1700 B.C., which distinctly bears two eyes and a curved mouth as a painted decoration.3,700-year-old smiley jug, via Smithsonian MagazineThe next oldest smiley has been discovered in documents dating to 1635, drawn by a Slovakian lawyer, Jan Ladislaides, expressing his satisfaction with the documents he signed. Other historical hand-written emojis have been counted: a Czech monk in 1741 deployed one in his signature, and the Danish poet Johannes V. Jensen accompanied his letters with smiley and frowny faces in the year 1900. Smiley signature dated to 1741, via Wikipedia There are a few other sources around at the same time as Ball who have also been given credit for originating the yellow smile in the United States: an ad for the film Lili in 1953, notepads from a Los Angeles ad agency in 1961, sweatshirts for New York's WMCA radio station in 1962, and a syndicated children's television show in 1963 called The Funny Company that used a smiley face in their logo and for their end titles with the message "Keep Smiling."WMCA sweater via WMCA Good GuysThere is a principle in science called "multiple discovery," also known as "simultaneous invention," in which several independent parties reach the same breakthrough, invention, or innovation, simply because the conditions of their foundational knowledge or the techniques that have become available are ripe for this discovery. The same theory has been posited in art, and it appears that in the U.S. in the early 60s, the time was right for yellow smiley faces.Mass marketing meets counter-cultureCharles Ball has said his father never regretted not trademarking his smiley face, but others who did saw huge profits off of their own merchandise and licensed products. In 1970, brothers Bernard and Murray Spain, who owned Hallmark card shops in Philadelphia, copyrighted a slightly altered version of Ball's smiley face. The Spain brothers' smiley was symmetrical, and they added the slogans "Have a Happy Day" and "Have a Nice Day," which differentiated it enough from a run-of-the-mill unbranded smiley for them to commodify it. 1970s "Have a Nice Day" merch, via MeTVThe entire purpose of their smiley was merchandising, and the brothers produced coffee mugs, t-shirts, bumper stickers, and of course buttons, which they sold more than 50 million of. Murray Spain has been quoted in the Telegraph, for a documentary about the proliferation of the smiley symbol, as being brazenly honest about the nature of their novelty item collection: "Our only desire was to make a buck... But when it became accepted as a symbol of happiness, we were thrilled." And make a buck they did: in 1973, they generated at least $1.5 million in revenue from smiley face and "Have a nice day,"-branded products. Since the smiley was mass-produced, it turned up everywhere, even in places that weren't so suitable for smiles. One Vietnam war veteran, Doug Kibbey, who was a US tank commander in 1972, recalled wearing one on his helmet: "The little brother of a stateside girlfriend sent me this [a smiley sticker], and having seen every imaginable (and a few unimaginable) permutations of 'Bad-Ass' helmet designes, I decided this was perversely sinister enough for my oblique sense of humor." 1972 Mad Magazine, via EtsyBecause of the over-saturation of smiley faces novelty goods in the U.S., and because such a simple symbol could so easily be perverted by context, the smiley face was quickly adopted and used ironically in counter-cultural movements throughout the 1970s and 80s. In 1972, it appeared on the cover of Mad magazine and DC comics created the creepy character of Boss Smiley, leader of an ultra-right wing in an issue of "Prez: The First Teen President" released in 1973. Another DC hit, "Watchmen," prominently featuring a blood-spattered smiley pin, would debut in 1986.Throughout the 1970s, musical groups like the Talking Heads and the Dead Kennedys subverted the smiley face. The UK 12-inch cover of Talking Heads "Psycho Killer" referenced the original Ball smiley, while the dead Kennedys' release of California Über Alles replaced swastikas in a collage depicting a Nuremberg-style rally with grinning smiley faces. The juxtaposition of smiley faces with militant aesthetics would continue to be utilized by the graffiti artist Banksy in the early 2000s, replacing the faces of riot cops with smiling yellow balls.California Über Alles cover, via PM PressA selectin of Banksy smiley cops, via Desktop NexusIn the 1980s, during what was called the Second Summer of Love, the smiley face became associated with rave culture, electronic dance music, and, of course, copious drug use. The subversion of the symbol became more common than its naïve usage, and after several deaths due to ecstasy use in the latter half of the decade, smiley merchandise was banned for a short time in the UK. The smiley was featured on the cover of a 1988 NME magazine being destroyed to symbolize the crackdown on psychedelic and party drugs.NME Magazine 1988, via NoiseyAfter the boom and bust of the acid house scene in the UK in the 80s, the smiley skipped across the pond to festoon US-partygoers' gear as the early 90s rave scene took off there. A smiley face with Xs for eyes and a wobbly mouth, lifted from the Lusty Lady strip club in Seattle, became the symbol for Nirvana's "Flower Sniffin, Kitty Pettin, Baby Kissin Corporate Rock Whores" merch released in 1991, and the association of smiley faces with drug-taking, degeneracy, and proto-YOLO party mentality is still strong. Fatboy Slim (real name Norman Cook), still proudly sports a smiley face tattoo and has been collecting smiley faces symbolizing their association with music and drug culture for the last 20 years. In an interview with Red Bull, he explains his love for the symbol: "It’s never quite been in fashion, but it’s never quite gone out of fashion either. Every now and then some designer will take it on and try to make it fashionable, but it’s always been a bit goofy and stupid. It’s always a bit in fashion and always a bit out of fashion – a bit like my career, really." The 2007 Anna Farris film "Smiley Face," in which she eats all of her roommate's pot cupcakes and suffers through a series of misadventures due to being stoned, continues the tradition of associating the innocent smiley with excessive drug use.Smiley Face (2007) theatrical poster, via IMP AwardsThe smiley face's unerring optimism has also been used as a symbol of horror. The Smiley Face Killer theory, which attempted to link together a series of murders from 1997 to 2008, based on a smiley face spray painted on nearby graffiti walls, was deemed by the Center for Homicide Research as unfounded, but has not stopped the internet from speculating that the smiley symbol could be a serial killer's calling card. The 2012 horror film, "Smiley," also played on the idea of the smiley face being appropriated by a bloodthirsty killer, who mutilates his own face to resemble the gaping eyes and slitted mouth of the icon, and murders teens who type "I did it for the lulz" three times, a pop-culture update to Bloody Mary.The Smiley Company's alternative historyAround the same time that the Spain brothers were spreading smiley-mania through novelty items in the US in the early 1970s, a French journalist named Franklin Loufrani started using his own version of the smiley face to mark positive news stories in France Soir. He got a trademark on the smiley face in France in October 1971, and started licensing the smiley to other publications and manufacturers almost immediately. Within two years, he was getting paid by Levi Strauss and the Mars candy company, and by 1997, when he handed the family business over to his son, Nicolas Loufrani, The Smiley Company (also known as SmileyWorld) was raking in $100 million per year in licensing fees. The Smiley Company holds the license for smiley faces and many other derivative trademarked characters in more than 100 countries, including the Bic pen company in France and 7-Eleven stores in Asia. Smiley® logo via The Smiley CompanyBut in the United States, Loufrani faced opposition when he attempted to file the trademark for Smiley clothes, stationary, mugs, bags, and toys. Walmart challenged SmileyWorld, fearing the trademark would infringe on their use of the smiley face in their "Rollback" pricing campaigns, which ran from 1990 to 2006. Although the terms of the agreement between Loufrani and Walmart have not been disclosed, Walmart did phase out their smiley mascot in 2006, only to have it return to advertise their deals 10 years later. If it wasn't clear from the aggressive scale of the Smiley marketing operation, The Smiley Company is determined to become the one and only global purveyor of smiley faces, going so far as to ignore all of the history of the icon up to the point that it was trademarked in France. The "Infingements" page of the Smiley website claims that "Smiley is the original creator of Internet graphic emoticons since 1997 and licensed globally to over 800 companies since then... The Smiley Company not only protect our original logo, but also our icons and various characters. Smiley has the rights to 3000 emoticons."In a 2017 interview with Vice, Nicolas Loufrani actually claims that emoijs were inspired by his smiley face designs. "I decided to change the logo to lots of different expressions to make it become more like a character expressing different emotions," Nicolas explains. "The first step was to design it in 3D, so I made it 3D. Then I started working on the emotions, lots of different emotions. I realised I could take it to different nations, just putting flags behind. I could do objects. I started doing different categories of Smiley. Lets do more of this. That became emoticons." He claims that The Smiley Dictionary published by The Smiley Company in 2001 was "the birth of a universal language," and laid the groundwork for emoji as we know it, although he is aware that somehow they simultaneously originated in Japan. The Official Smiley Dictionary in 2001, via the Wayback MachineAs Loufrani explains it, "[Emojis] are definitely inspired by our smileys. They are yellow faces. They have a more Kawaii, Japanese direction in the face, but they are inspired by what we do. They started around 2010, when Apple started to include emoji in the Unicode. It started getting used by a lot of internet platforms and then it became a huge phenomenon. A renewed phenomenon."A simple search proves this is patently untrue, as well as the claim on The Smiley Company's history page that "the first Smiley appears on an Alcatel mobile in 1996." The first smiley face represented in ASCII text was written by Scott E. Fahlman, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, in 1982, who suggested that ":-)" should be used to mark jokes. In October of 1992, the Unicode consortium included character U+263A, White Smiling Face (☺), and U+263B, Black Smiling Face (☻) in Version 1.0.0 of Unicode. It wasn't until 1998 that Shigetaka Kurita, of NTT Docomo in Japan, would release 176 symbols, including smiley faces, that would later evolve into emojis as we know them. But clearly all of these developments in adapting the universally-recognized smiley face icon to screen text pre-dated and had nothing to do with The Smiley Company's licensing scheme, and it is pure ego for The Smiley Company to believe otherwise.The Smiley brand in 2019 touts "The power of positive propaganda," and states it is "more than an icon, brand and lifestyle. We are a spirit and philosophy, a reminder of how powerful a smile can be." As a lifestyle brand, Smiley exemplifies global capitalism, and is even turning to Smiley surveillance technology in their "Smiley-O-Meter," web app. The Smiley-O-Meter requests webcam access, and then uses facial expression recognition to measure how much you are smiling as "Hilarious Moments" flash on the screen. At the end, they provide a heavily branded GIF of your own smile: The smiley face: once an icon of happiness used to encourage disgruntled corporate employees to smile more, turned into a mass-market phenomenon, and now an aggressive multinationally-licensed "lifestyle brand." Regardless of whether you use :), ☺, or 🙂, know that the simple smiley is much more than meets the eye. Behind those two dots and curved line is a long history of a seemingly innocent symbol being appropriated and re-appropriated over and over, and it means whatever you want it to mean. :)  

Taking part in play and games are activities deeply ingrained in the human spirit. In his groundbreaking sociological book French Les jeux et les hommes, the French Sociologist Roger Caillois posits that there are only four types of play: Agon (i.e. competition, like chess), Alea (i.e. games of chance), Mimicry (i.e. roleplaying) and Ilinx (i.e. altering normal perception of one’s world-experience by riding a rollercoaster).
Meanwhile, the passive twin of play - watching TV in your underpants, dumbly cramming snacks into your mouth - has equally profound societal effects, with some research suggesting that watching screen-based entertainment triggers such high levels of dopamine release that viewers are literally entranced, just like your parents said you were, you lazy so-and-so.
So sport, games and play are intrinsically popular in our society. And the best creative minds of our times have painted a rich canvas of possible evolutions of sport, play, toys and games. Unfortunately the best creative minds are hiding their ideas under a bushel, and all the ones that make it into mainstream entertainment are rubbish.
MONTAG takes a look at what might be in store for us in the future of fun and games; and whether we’re close to them yet - with a score marked out of five footballs ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️.

TV Entertainment
TV is the ultimate Fun Machine. Watching TV is in effect, a sport: one where viewers compete with their own willpower in a battle to stop watching so much TV. TV, invariably wins - but the reigning champ needs to keep mutating to hold our attention, and so gameshows get weirder, and TV content gets wilder. So what does the future have in store, according to fiction?
The Running Man:  ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️
The Running Man - not to be confused with the dance craze of the same name which was popularised by MC Hammer - is a remarkably and enjoyably dumb 1980s Schwarzenegger movie set in, erm, 2017, where the USA has become, erm, a chaotic totalitarian state. Our hero is a wrongly-convicted police helicopter pilot (truly, the most righteously glamourous of jobs). And, as luck may have it, a revolutionarily violent TV gameshow has captured the public's imagination. Could... Arnie somehow become involved?
Yes, naturally. He’s offered a choice to win back his freedom: “Hard time… or prime time.” Naturally Arnie picks the option that offers the most opportunity for bloody mayhem and bone-headed one-liners, and enters the hit gameshow The Running Man where he’s hunted by professional killers on TV.



We have not yet created gameshows which routinely kill people for entertainment. Well, not in the physical sense. Instead, we're subjecting people to a fate worse than death: public humiliation.



Late-naughties BBC gameshow Hole In The Wall, where micro-celebrities wore Lycra jumpsuits similar to Arnold’s and had to adopt ludicrous shapes to fit though - you guessed it - a hole in a moving wall, was one of the first shows where the participants’ decorum was brutally slaughtered on national television, and for that reason,  ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ are awarded.

Videodrome: ⚽️ ⚽️
OK, gameshows are supposed to be dumb, and they're not on TV all the time. But no-one watches TV any more, grandaaaad - so in our world of Infinite Content™ surely we have more opportunities to watch thoughtful entertainment instead? Not according to David Cronenberg.



Videodrome is a predictably skin-crawling movie by body-horror specialist Cronenberg, and it features an illicit late-night TV channel that hooks people with graphic, murderous video footage that viewers can’t stop watching.
Videodrome depicts the Future Of Media, all right - in some ways, it's a kind of proto-Youtube, except instead of being desperately addicted to hyper-violent video footage, we're hooked on endless unboxing videos, vlogs and Buzzfeed Food #content. Oh, and Youtubers.
via GIPHY
Logan Paul is a young man from a wealthy family who sports Princess Diana’s blow-dried hair and spends his time uploading videos featuring #content that is unfunny, risk-free, and self-congratulatory, yet apparently is meant to be the exact opposite. He's sort of an amiable fool, albeit one you don't want to live next door to. There are many Youtubers like him, grinding out asinine #content which often feature long diatribes over being “demonitized” by Youtube - yet millions of viewers can’t tear their eyes away.
If addiction is the act of continuing to repeat something despite these actions being self-destructive, then, like the panicked viewers of Videodrome, Logan’s viewers are hooked on images of the horrors that lurk within humanity.
With that in mind, it's only the fact that Youtube demonetized Logan's infamous video shot in a Japanese "suicide forest" (that features an actual dead body hanging from a tree) that we're only awarding ⚽️ ⚽️.

Future Sports
Sports! Who doesn't love sport? Everyone loves watching people wearing colourful clothes and running fast or kicking things. And there's loads of them! Even sports you've never heard of, like Kabaddi, have millions of fans. So why would we even consider inventing new ones? Because humans are incapable of saying "nope, no more for me, thank you, I've had enough," that's why.
Future Sport: ⚽️ ⚽️
The straight-to-home-video “classic” Future Sport is a movie that sets the de facto standard for all cinematic “future sports”, and it proclaims  them all to be exactly as you’d expect: ultraviolent, neon-lit, slightly metallic, absurdly camp, and clad with lashings of lycra.
Future Sport features a sport which is played in the future and is thus named FutureSport - something which must be confusing for people in the actual future, when the sport is supposedly being played, and would thus be a “present sport.”



Unfathomably, Future Sport features 1990s superstar Wesley Snipes, yet focuses, equally unfathomably, on Dean Cain, a man who played Superman on TV for a while. It's a kind of every-action-movie-in-one movie: at one point Cain takes down terrorists using skills he has learned from playing FutureSport, with the offical FutureSport match ball, because Future Sport.
In a kind of future-meta-verse alignment, Future Sport also features the hoverboards and extending robo-baseball bats from Back to the Future Part II.
FutureSport itself is apparently an ultra-violent game of dodgeball, or hockey, or handball, or something, and is played with an electrified ball by players on, erm, rollerblades. Futuresport may or may not have been influenced by the popular 90s videogame Speedball II, but at this point who cares.
Yet is FutureSport (the sport) any more stupid than early-noughties made-for-TV sport Slamball, a comical “sport” best described by the Youtube comments, “What do you get when you mix the sport of basketball and trampolines? SLAM BALL,” “How can we turn NBA Jam into a real sport? -Slam Ball founder,” and “WHERE CAN I SIGN UP TO PLAY THIS SPORT?”



In actuality, 2018 Dean Cain is somehow worse than the movie Future Sport, and is now a man who “argues with randos about @realdonaldtrump in Mark Hamill's mentions”, making the present worse than the future predicted by the movie, and thus only earns ⚽️ ⚽️ .

Future Games and Play
Let's be clear: Games are different to Sports in that they are more in line with the Alea and Mimicry types of play. And how close are fictional games to reality?

(*Image via Chartboost/iOS App Store)
War Games: ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️
What’s remarkable about the future predicted by Wargames is not that people would enjoy playing internet-connected games about fighting wars (see all these identical mobile war games and feel your enthusiasm for humanity sag) but the fact that nuclear war was predicted to be a game of tic-tac-toe which can be accidentally initiated by someone dumb enough to press a couple of buttons on a computer.
Instead of worrying whether the orange person whose finger currently hovers over the nuclear button is dumb enough to hit it, let’s instead just hope that The Donald fast forwards the movie (this sounds crazy but it has precedent) to watch the climatic scene in War Games where the computer becomes smarter than humans and learns that “the only way to win in nuclear war is not to play.”
Thus, because the kind of decisions that could potentially end all life on earth are playing out as a kind of meta-text-game (albeit on Trump's Twitter feed, and not the IMSAI 8080 desktop PC used by Matthew Broderick), War Games "wins" a solid ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ mark.

Bonus #content: The Hoverboard: ⚽️
Finally, any analysis of future play could not overlook the most desired toy of them all. Of all the futuristic inventions in cinema, the Hoverboard from Back To The Future Part II is surely the one that captured people’s imagination the most, combining the twin great human ambitions of flying and looking cool in public in one lurid and admittedly amazing device.
Famously, Back To The Future Part II was set in 2015, and when the year finally arrived, floating skateboards didn’t exist. Instead, “Hoverboards” - plasticky two-wheeled Segways that stumble over small pebbles and spontaneously catch fire - did. There’s a parable for modern consumerism here. One, single, sad ⚽️ awarded.

In Part One of MONTAG’s poke around in the future of music, Joe Sparrow discovered that we’ve been stepping back from the music making progress for a while, and how we’re already consuming music that’s created “robotically.”
In Part Two, having comforted himself that humans are essential to making music, Joe discovers how actually music will be churned out by faceless, automated music factories - and it’ll make the world more musical, more enjoyable and more exciting.

What is life?



Music unites us as people or strengthens us on a human level. Maybe your nights are spent prodding flashing buttons on a Maschine, producing the next banger to soundtrack David Guetta’s next public meltdown; or maybe you just slip on chunky headphones, set Spotify to Private Mode, and lose yourself in the Spice Girls.
So if music is so essentially human, won’t music that’s whelped by a server – not a songwriter – just be rubbish?
Well, no. Everything you know about music – who makes it, how it’s made, how you’ll feel – is already changing, although you might not even notice…

Robot Rock



The last time I poked the AI box was to see if technology was ready to take over my creative role and write my MONTAG article for me. It wasn’t an encouraging exploration, and ended with me having to write the damn thing myself after all. Pfft. So much for robots replacing our work, eh?
Except: that piece did end with these words:

“make no mistake, the machines are coming for your job.”

To recap: if you’re a truck driver, now is the time to either start thinking about other jobs, or how you and the other thousands of drivers are going to complain to the dithering politicians afterwards. (And if you’re a smug creative – a phrase which is certainly oxymoronic – note that your job will be gobbled up by technology too.)
But let’s not linger on the impending job-hunt anxiety. What if the future is not all doom and gloom? Automation theory states that when all the simple jobs will be done by robots or AI, us humans have time to get on with doing unique, human things, like creating stuff.
So what if the things that new technology brings us are new types of beauty, unthinkable creative curveballs, and tools that empower us to be super-artists? Here’s how the most universal art form of all - music - will be tweaked, re-shaped and blossom.

Pretend we're dead



Spotify isn't a music company, really: it’s a data company which shuffles around ones and zeros that happen to be mp3 files.
Open Spotify - or any of the identical music streaming apps – and you’re faced with playlists compiled for specific feelings and situations: music to help you focus, songs to work out to, and music to fall asleep too.
While it’s tempting to suggest that clicking on the latter reveals the entirety of Coldplay’s back catalogue, it actually throws up playlists like Peaceful Piano, which are packed with beautiful pieces by critically-acclaimed artists like Nils Frahm, Max Richter, and, erm, Sigimund and Lo Mimeaux.

The latter two have been disdainfully - and, in Trump’s Fake-News world, fashionably - called “Fake Artists”.
These artists are, if you like, human bots: pseudonyms of a few music production teams who grind out music, and lots of it. In bulk, to order, and at a high quality, which is then sold outright to Spotify.
The benefits of this in-bulk music are clear: padding out playlists with these songs in between the expensive “real” artists - who require a royalty fee for every stream - Spotify saves money.
And listeners probably don’t even realise, or care: if you’re using the songs to fall asleep, what’s the difference if Lo Mimeaux isn’t a critically-acclaimed “real” artist? Tinkle those ivories and zen me to sleep, baby.

What Does Your Soul Look Like?



record scratch
But what does this have to do with future technology and music-making?
It’s this: cheap human-music is the first step to cheaper automated-music, and there are parallels in other businesses.
Consider how you may have made Uber an essential part of your life, and Uber essentially subsidises your fare every time you take a trip. That’s because, one theory states, Uber are waiting until the most expensive part of the process - the human driver - can be replaced, and then the real money rolls in.
Meanwhile, users don’t notice or care: they focus furiously on not drunkenly vomiting in the taxi as they’re driven home from the bar either way.
A cynic would say this mentality, minus the possibility of vomit (unless you’re listening to a Celine Dion album), would apply to music too.
As important as image is, we rarely care about the source of music as long as we enjoy it: very few people in the West listened to K-Pop before Gangham Style exploded in popularity via sheer crazy persuasiveness.
Enjoy Nils Frahm while you can tell the difference.

Computer Love



Computers are only starting to write music, but soon they’ll be writing big hits, and you’ll be singing along. So what is the likelihood that AI can nudge the puny humanoids out of the creative process entirely?
Let’s answer that question with another question: do you loathe jazz or do you merely hate it?
That’s mean, of course: plenty of people love jazz. It’s just that… well, jazz can be shorthand for the kind of tuneless, solipsistic music-meandering that AI-driven music can hopefully banish for good.
The late Tony Wilson – who, as founder of Factory Records discovered Joy Division, New Order, Happy Mondays, and (allegedly) turned down The Smiths because he didn’t like Morrissey - said that “Jazz is the last refuge of the untalented. Jazz musicians enjoy themselves more than anyone listening to them does.”
Let’s assume for a moment that this is true. So where does that leave DeepJazz?

DeepJazz is a jazz machine. Its AI was knocked up in a weekend as part of a hackathon, and it immediately started spitting out the kind of piano-tinklin’, note-meanderin’, taste-dodgin’ jazz made by humans the world over.
Jazz afficionados will rightly turn their nose up at DeepJazz - but to the rest of us it is recognisably jazz.
So if AI is able to make bad jazz, is it not essentially just… making jazz? What is good jazz anyway?

Don’t Believe The Hype?



In 2012, a team at Sony CSL’s research lab in Paris trained an AI programme to listen to pop music, and then asked it to make its own with that it had learned. It produced Daddy’s Car, a song with a structure and lyrics in the style of the Beatles, which was then sung by a poor inconsequential human being.

It’s… fine. It’s not Penny Lane, but it’s not Dig A Pony either.
Recently, Spotify hired the man who is the brains behind it all. Remember their “fake artists” making “fake music?” You can see where this is going.
If a streaming service or label could create a bot that writes mega-hits, we'd all win. Listeners could hear more music that they love, and streaming services would be happy too.
How? If a song as utterly MOR as the Zayn Malik/Taylor Swift snooze-fest I Don't Wanna Live Forever can get over half a billion streams on Spotify, imagine how valuable it would be if Spotify-Bot could write a song that big without having to pay someone for it.

Hallelujah



OK. So where does this leave music now? What does it mean for listeners? And what about poor musicians, who get, on average, 0.7¢ per Spotify stream of their song?
Music, despite endless “it’s not like the good old days” hand-wringing, is going to get better. It always does.
If you crossed the ethos of Brian Eno’s Music For Airports and the battery-production ethos of Spotify’s “Fake Artists” you’d not land a million miles away from Muzak™ - the name of the vapid background music you hear in lifts, shopping malls and waiting rooms.
But vapidity is not where music is headed: we don't await a world of panpipes and music that sounds like Enya B-sides. Instead, there’s going to be a lot more music, wherever and whenever you want it - and it’s going to fit the situation you’re in. And that’s cool.
AI is going to make more good songs: whether completely or partially autonomously. Few people panicked that keyboards replaced real orchestras on pop songs.
So why worry too much about the songwriters? Truly good human songwriters will always be treasured for as long as they write amazing music.
Now, if you really want to worry about the future of music, consider a completely human-free process: songs written, produced, and performed autonomously from start to finish.
Something to think about when you’re on the way to a Hatsune Miku gig…

Issue four of MONTAG is about Modern Money.
And in its purest sense, there’s nothing more modern than cryptocurrencies: when it comes to paying for stuff, they are somewhere between the bleeding edge, the wild west, and the new normal.
When people think about the future of money, they don’t think of foldin’ money or swipin’ money, tappin’ money, or even a plastic card at all: they think of… nothing.
That’s because cyrptocurrencies like Bitcoin sorta-kinda don’t exist. They feel ephemeral. Yet they’re not. They exist. But you know, they also sort of don’t. And all this yes, but, no but makes tomorrow’s currencies seem out the reach of us, normal, can-I-pay-with-cash-or-card? spenders.
And that’s wrong, because cryptocurrencies are designed to be in our hands, and liberating us from banks, corruption, fraud and, well… banks.
The decentralised nature of cryptocurrency is its strength (transactions are recorded in a permanent audit trail, are viewable by anyone, and no-one controls the ledger) and, to newcomers, its weakness (OMFG what does that even mean, how does it even work, and how do I buy milk with it?)

via GIPHY
MONTAG prides itself on its glorious ignorance. And in this article, we’re arguing that you should not feel concerned that Bitcoin et al are utterly bewildering, intangible and infuriating.
Instead, we’re suggesting that this feeling is the default setting for dealing in the Glorious Crypto Future, and that you should embrace it, for the sake of humanity itself.
So here’s MONTAG’s guide to how to be able to tell your friends that you’re “really into Crypto right now” and not be lying, and yet still not really know anything about it.
Don't worry: it's written by someone who knows very little. Come on in, the Crypto’s lovely.

On why the tiny bit you know about cryptocurrency by the end of this admittedly confused article will still leave you more informed (and wealthier) than 99% of people
There are a million breathless articles, forum posts, Twitter feeds, and Facebook groups about every single cryptocoin that try and explain how it works and why you should care. Every metaphor is tortured, every diagram an octopus-orgy of arms and blobs. It’s really hard to find a good, clear description of either Bitcoin (or any other coin) or the blockchain technology behind it.
That’s A Good Thing.
It’s good for the same reason that you don’t hear a good, simple description of how banking works. It’s really, really complex, and the “experts” only truly understand one part of it well, if at all.
Except with Bitcoin, and all the other crypocurrencies, it’s useful to learn something, anything, even if it’s half-true, only semi-correct, or only feels partially understandable, like a German compound word that you can’t translate directly into your own language.
That’s because crypto, while based around a completely transparent system, also means shunning trust itself, to an extent. Scary huh? But think about it: you’ve never seen your “money”. Trust is all that really keeps you from questioning the reality of your hard-earned Euros, Dollars, Pounds or Zloty.

via GIPHY
You’ve never touched your money.
It's a number on a payslip, or in an app; a few digits that you transfer to your landlord each month. The coins and paper in your wallet are not money -they’re just something there in lieu of it (go on, read the small print, it’s pretty worrying, frankly).
It’s all rather nothing-y when you think about it. But that’s what money is: a complicated device with everything and nothing at its centre.
The only difference with Crypto is that you’re the bank now. You can’t trust a bank to take care of it. There are no banks: it’s all you. But as 2008’s worldwide simultaneous economic bed-shitting demonstrated, you can’t trust banks anyway. So take the power back!
Of course that also means taking back the risk, the panic and the worry. And that’s a big part of crypto, at least for now. The truth is that if you lose a piece of paper with a convoluted number on it, you lose all your money, forever.
But would you rather (literally) bet your mortgage on keeping a long number safe somewhere, or on some of Wall Street’s finest making a bizarro decision and sending the value of your house tumbling into a void forever?

Close your eyes and jump
Imagine you are naked. And imagine Crypto to be a beautiful, valuable painting that you can access and keep, but only through 100 panes of that mottled glass they use in the windows of toilets. Bear with me. I told you the metaphors were bad.
To get closer to the painting and to see it more clearly, you’re going to have to go through a whole load of these panes of glass. So the ride will be painful, noisy, confusing, bloody, terrifying, and confusing (again) but you’ll feel utterly exhilarated with each leap towards clarity.
Don’t worry about reasons - there are no real reasons in the world of crypto. Just understand that the future is that way - through all those damn panes of glass.

Some assorted advice I ignored on my journey buying Crypto, and then later learnt the hard way
• Cynicism is a type of currency too: Essential advice from my MONTAG colleague Kathryn, quoting a running joke on Reddit’s many crypto forums: “The best day to buy Bitcoin is two years ago, the second best time is today.” This is always true.
• Your perception of money-related panic and fear will mutate in relation to your investment: A tech-savvy friend lazily bought a small amount Bitcoin back in 2012 without really thinking too much about what to do with it.
The surprise in this story is not that he then lost the Bitcoin (there are a million stories about that too, and expect to read plenty of clickbait horror stories in the Daily Mail in the coming years) but that when, five years later, he found it on the USB drive he left it on, as he realised it was now worth a small fortune, the excitement was wholly tempered by the wild reverse-Sehnsucht panic of Oh-my-God-but-what-if-I’d-lost-it-and-then-later-remembered-about-it-oh-god-oh-god. Fortunately you can buy whisky with Bitcoin, and he calmed down.
• Everyone’s story is: “if only I’d invested earlier, I’d be so much richer now.” Stop right there, friend: this is the point of Bitcoin. Its price can only go up. So stop worrying and keep drinking the Crypto Flavor-Aid.
• The idea of value itself is fluid and changing so who cares about those spikes and troughs: One of the earliest transactions using Bitcoin was when someone paid 20 Bitcoin for a pair of alpaca socks*. Go to any Bitcoin exchange and check how much 20 Bitcoin would cost in fiat currency today: it’d be the same as a car.
But the socks were a great bargain at the time. So why even think about the equivalent fiat currency fee?
*or something; like any new online community, the Alpaca Socks story is a kind of self-replicating myth: it can mean whatever you want and can be told however you like, with any intended moral you like.
via GIPHY
• When your friend who knows better says, “buy it now,” just do it: Yes, your investment may go down (and probably will.) You may lose it all. You may become incredibly wealthy. But that’s all in the short term: a crypto-enabled future is inevitable and anything you are left with, post-disaster, post-triumph, post-confusion, is going to be incredibly useful. Except Dogecoin. Poor Dogecoin.
• You are the bank. So be the bank. Buying crypto is easy: you go to an exchange like Coinbase, pay them money and they give you sweet, sweet cryptocoins in return.
But storing it is still confusing, despite many determined best efforts. So it’s easiest just to leave the coins on the exchange: a number on the screen that constantly changes in value. The excitement!
But here’s the point: if you keep your coins on an exchange you don’t own your own money.
Put it anywhere else, and you own it. Keep them on the exchange, and you’re kind of still keeping a foot in the old way of using money, and crypto is all about going big, or going home, sunshine!
Losses, mistakes, panic, confusion compounded by more confusion, and desperate searches for that piece of paper with a random 128-character code on to unlock your utterly ethereal crypto-wallet for your utterly ethereal crypto-coins is what our crypto future is all about, baby!
via GIPHY
• Buy a physical wallet to store your coins. Just do it: they look like a USB stick and cost ten times as much, and no, they don’t “store” your money (it doesn’t exist, remember, dummy!), but… well, put it this way - this writer slept better after buying one, and he doesn’t even really know why or how that is the case, but knows that it’s true.
• HODL: if you don’t know what HODL means, don’t worry, it’s just another one of those in-jokes that you’ll learn to love, believe in and clutch close to your chest like a comfort blanket on those days when your coin of choice’s value graph suddenly decides to investigate what life would be like it if it hung around near the bottom of the y-axis for a while.
HODL sort-of means “hold” (as in, stop worrying and hold onto your investment) and sort of means Hold On for Dear Life (as in “I’m just going to HODL for a while and stop checking Coinbase every five minutes”). But of course, in the world of Crypto, it can mean whatever you want.
• Bullish BS: If anyone involved even tangentially in finance asks about your crypto-strategy, just glance around as if you have something very important to relay and keep quietly repeating that you are “Bullish on Crypto.” People will raise eyebrows and nod sagely.

Yes, but you never told me how I’d buy milk with it!
You know how you buy milk now with a contactless debit card? Boringly, it’ll be like that. Except you’ll load some Bitcoin (or Litecoin, or zCoin, or Ripple, or…) onto an app on your phone and tap that instead.
And that’s it. Maybe you’ll be paid in Bitcoin (or…), or maybe you’ll need to buy it, a bit like a pre-paid debit card. But you’ll be able to buy your cow-juice, don’t worry.

"People have long feared that mechanization might cause mass unemployment. This never happened because, as old professions became obsolete, new professions evolved, and there was always something humans could do better than machines. Yet this is not a law of nature, and nothing guarantees it will continue to be like that in the future." - Yuval Noah Harari, The Rise of the Usless Class
"Men and machines are good at fundamentally different things. People have intentionality – we form plans and make decisions in complicated situations. We are less good at making sense of enormous amounts of data. Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at efficient data processing but struggle to make basic judgments that would be simple for any human." – Peter Thiel, Zero To One
Much has been written about how robots and artificial intelligence will replace workers, but many futurists are looking forward to man and machine working side by side in harmony, collaborating and augmenting the others' skills and shortcomings.
Mechanical Turk is already putting this theory into action by building the unique qualities of human workers into an application programming interface.
Mechanical Turk (or MTurk), which is owned by Amazon, is "a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence". There are many things humans are still better at than computers, such as image and pattern recognition, audio transcription, and seeking specific information that can only be described in human terms. As far as artificial intelligence has progressed, computers still aren't very good at doing things like naming colors, rewriting sentences, or picking out letters from images – we're safe from AI annihilation as long as they still can't beat CAPTCHAs.



As it's written on the MTurk home page, tasks like these have traditionally been done by hiring a large temporary workforce. Through the MTurk platform, workers (also known as Turkers), are now available online globally and 24/7 to do these jobs that only humans can do.
Technically, the term is "microwork," coined by entrepreneur Leila Janah, who conceptualized modern work as a virtual assembly line, with microwork being a unit of labor that is the smallest possible to accomplish a task.
Artificial Artificial Intelligence



It's also called "artificial artificial intelligence" – because while these tedious microwork units seem like the sort of thing that could or should be automated by now, they still require a human touch. The name of Mechanical Turk comes from the first famous artificial A.I.: an automaton developed in the 18th century with the form of a stereotypical Turkish man looming over a chessboard atop a large cabinet. This proto-robot appeared to be able to play chess, but had a human operator hidden inside of it moving the pieces magnetically from beneath. The doors built into the cabinet with the chess board on top of it were designed to be opened and peered through, to give the illusion that the Turk was purely mechanical.
While the orientalist stereotype of the turbaned Turkish chess master has been deemed somewhat outdated and problematic, computers that actually can beat humans at chess like Deep Blue are now a reality; and the illusion of machine intelligence with a Wizard-of-Oz-esque man (or many) behind the curtain likewise lives on.
You load sixteen tons and what do you get?



Mechanical Turk could only exist in the 20 Minutes Into The Future world we inhabit at this stage of late capitalism: somewhere between the Gig Economy that reifies those who don't eat or sleep in order to maximize their productivity doing independent contractor work and short term freelance jobs (as exemplified by Fiverr's unintentionally anti-motivational "You might be a doer," campaign), and the paradigm of digital nomadism: being able to work wherever and whenever you want through the magic of technology.

"Pros: Work at Home. Cons: Pays pennies on the dollar." 

Those micro-units of work add up: Mechanical Turk relies on crowdsourcing a large pool of human-exclusive data points from a bustling ant colony of individuals. Amazon claims to have a workforce of 500,000 Turkers available to do these "HITs" (Human Intelligence Tasks), but according to research published in January of 2018 by Panos Ipeirotis, a professor of data science at New York University who has studied work on the platform since 2007, there seem to be 2-5K workers available at any given time, with a total of 10-25K full-time Turkers.
Turkers set their own hours and choose which HITs they want to do; they're technically self-employed and classed as contractors. Many reviewers commenting on the gig on Indeed.com write that it's a great job for stay at home moms: “It's good if you are a housewife with no children and love to work on the computer all day. Pros: Work at Home. Cons: Pays pennies on the dollar.”
That's the downside: although many tasks take seconds or minutes to complete, the majority of tasks (61%, according to the Pew Research Center) pay less than 10 cents each – and that's after Amazon takes their cut from the requester who created the HIT. Workers outside of the U.S. and India also can't deposit their earnings directly to their bank accounts, and are paid in Amazon gift cards.
As far as company stores go, Amazon has a large enough global reach and product selection that they could be the source for many or all of a full-time Turker's groceries, home goods, etc., but it still feels like a trap to demand that much of the money paid out by Amazon to these workers goes right back into Bezos' pocket, and for the online outsourcing industry (presumably including other microwork platforms like Fiverr, oDesk, Crowdflower, and Clickworker) to be expected to pull in 15 to 25 billion dollars by 2020, someone, many someones, obviously have to be getting the short end of the stick.



Most Turkers make significantly less than the U.S. minimum wage – roughly half make less than $5 an hour, and according to another study the median wage is less than $2 hourly. But for many workers, it isn't their only source of income. As another reviewer of the site notes: "You must understand the system to get paid."
Turkin' for the weekend
Having read that Mechanical Turk is either an amazing opportunity to beat boredom while getting paid to do work that's mindless enough to watch TV at the same time, or the equivalent of a "virtual sweatshop," several journalists have gone undercover in the Turking world to see what all the fuss is about for periods of one to 30 days.
Jeremy Wilson tried it for The Kernel in 2013, and after reading and itemizing receipts, mimicking facial expressions in his webcam, and flagging potentially offensive content, wrote "it really isn't that bad. In fact, if you have a better aptitude for mindless clicking games then me you might even find it enjoyable. I won’t be returning to Mechanical Turk. I’m not cut out for it."
Trent Hamm tried a similar experiment, Turking for a day for The Simple Dollar and also reached similar conclusions: "I also might use it if I was bored while watching a television program with my wife – but even then, I’d much more likely spend my time on Twitter or something like that. I value my mental energy at a rate higher than minimum wage." (Good for you, Trent).
However, Eric Limer, who also tried Turking for Gizmodo, had a much better experience, finding it "alarmingly easy to slip into a Turking daze." In his analysis of the platform, he tried to understand what each task that he undertook (survey taking, more receipt reading, describing videos and rephrasing statements, as well as that mimicking facial expressions task again) would accomplish in the real world. One HIT in particular, about labeling materials of objects in an image, sent him into existential crisis territory:

"I still have no goddamn idea what it was about. Then, while idly wondering if this was a job dreamed up by a human or a part-way sentient computer, I ran up against an even more pressing question. I found a little dot that said 'person.' Well shit, I thought to myself. What are the materials of a person? Brain matter, muscle tissue, fingernails, aspirations, nostril hair, a soul? Fortunately the options were limited"

Limer also admits his experience is only the tip of the iceberg, because real Turkers work significantly harder, and ironically, need a lot of help from their computers to automate the process of doing tasks that only humans can do.
Turkers of the World Unite!
Reddit's "Turkkit" forum at /r/mturk/ has a count of 34K Turkers subscribed, and hosts daily discussions where people post their activity summaries including the number of HITs they submitted, approvals and payments, as well as their earnings for the previous week. They also share things like warnings against bad requesters and share tips for finding the highest paying HITs, which has its own subreddit: /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor. Plus, there are in depth discussions about the state of the platform and the psychological toll Turking can take – avoiding and mitigating burnout are constant topics.
"Scripts" are also frequently mentioned. These are browser extensions like Turkopticon, which helps weed out the best HITs or programs like automated hourly rate calculators, which tell you which jobs will be worth the time. Scripts can also re-map keyboards to make answering HITs easier, or automate queueing to speed up the number of HITs that can be done in a row.
Kristy Milland is an activist for the Turker community and community manager for another online hub, Turker Nation. In an interview with Sarah Kessler for Wired, in advance of Kessler's book Gigged: The End of the Job and the Future of Work, she describes some of the crazy things she did whilst Turking in order to make the $100 a day she needed to survive. In the process, Milland got a repetitive stress injury and didn't have health insurance to treat it.

"The creativity of business in avoiding its responsibility to workers never ceases to astound"

Without benefits like health care or any of the labor protections available to full time employees in the U.S., Turkers have learned to look out for one another. In addition to crowdsourcing their own insider tips via Reddit and the forums, and creating open source software to make Turking easier, they've also created platforms like Dynamo, which organized Turkers to lobby against Amazon's increase in fees for requesters and created things like ethical guidelines for academic research using Mechanical Turk.
Unfortunately, the Dynamo platform is now largely defunct, in part because to ensure the platform was being used by Turkers, Dynamo used MTurk itself, creating a HIT to get a code and register new users. Someone at Amazon must have caught wind of this, because the requester account that created HITs for Dynamo registrations was suspended.
Some Turkers interviewed for The Atlantic were afraid to use their real names for fear of repercussions from Amazon, because this kind of account suspension seems to mysteriously fall on those who challenge it. These Turkers also described common practices like setting alarms to wake them up at 2 or 3 AM when a good HIT was available.
Imagine waking up to a klaxon at 3 AM to get on the computer to click for pennies: not ideal working conditions. As a lawyer for the National Employment Law Project puts it, "The creativity of business in avoiding its responsibility to workers never ceases to astound."
But there is hope for the future of microwork. A group of researchers at Stanford have published plans to create an almost identical crowdsourced microwork platform called Daemo that would be self-governing and enable workers to build sustainable careers. As of the time that Wired covered Daemo's progress in August of 2017, it was not yet built to scale, but Milland was hopeful: "If you could create a platform that’s identical in every single way [to MTurk], and add one benefit—it could be as simple as, ‘We’ll listen to you and we’ll update the site per your recommendations’—everyone would move,” she says. “If we could provide them with a platform that does even more than that, it’s a no-brainer. It would kill it." But Milland is also still holding out hope for a platform created by and for the workers themselves.
In the meantime, Turkers gotta Turk: and some may still choose to do it regardless of the work conditions, all while Amazon's reach and power ever-increases. But will artificial intelligence progress enough to make microwork obsolete any time soon? Or will there always be tasks that only humans can do, with human workers relegated to repetitive, mindless, and poorly-compensated jobs in the virtual factories of the future?
As Jared Lanier has pointed out in Who Owns The Future?, MTurk and its ilk allow humans to be interchanged like software components and produce information like magic. Hopefully this particular parlor trick won't fool us forever.

MONTAG SHORT FICTION #007
MONTAG publishes curious short fiction, exploring our strange future and what it will feel like when we get there. They take the technology you're interested in as a starting point and show where it might take us. The stories are outré, evocative, and atypical; they're also closer to today than you think.
When our laptops are hacked, we feel violated. In Ransomwear, we find out that when our wearables are hacked, we might feel something closer to terror...

Bounding up to her apartment building after a sweaty several-kilometer run in the early evening, Victoria stopped and tapped her WristLit. The tiny LED screen lit up, displaying the number of calories she just burned. Not bad, she thought, entering the lobby of her building. She swiped her wrist to get on the elevator and into her apartment on the ninth floor.
The lights came on as she entered and sat down on the floor of the apartment, stretching her hamstrings and swiping through some evening news headlines. More missile testing from North Korea... ransomware of unknown origin spreading all over the world... ooh! and a video of a cute dog that was trained to stand up and wear little pants.
She marked the dog video “watch later.”
She took her running shoes off and walked to the kitchen to heat up a microwave meal for dinner. Her WristLit buzzed to remind her that she had a meeting tomorrow at 9 AM, and suggested an optimized bedtime. It would wake her up after the appropriate number of REM cycles for maximum refreshment, based on what time she managed to get to sleep.
After showering and eating quickly, and chuckling at the little dog wearing human pants, she got into bed. Checking the time on her wrist, she noticed the WristLit needed a software update, so she tapped “Update overnight” and fell asleep.
The next morning, her arm felt warm when the WristLit woke her up. The band, a woven metal mesh made of tiny plates that rearranged themselves to accommodate wrist movement, was definitely at its tightest setting. I must have been really tossing and turning, she thought, ...but I slept fine.
Turning off the alarm, an alert popped up to remind her of the morning’s meeting. She got out of bed to get ready. Dressed and armed with a smoothie for the road, she grabbed her purse and headed for the door.
But it wouldn’t open. She swiped her WristLit several times, and it stayed locked. That’s strange, she thought. She inspected the door frame, nothing seemed to be blocking the sensor. She inspected her wrist.
There was a bright red screen overlaid on the main display.
“OOOPS, UR WRISTLIT HAS BEEN ENCRYPTED! NOTHING WORKS UNTIL U PAY. U HAVE 2 DAYS AND 16 HOURS LEFT. TO PAY, CLICK ‘PAY NOW.’”
The message scrolled across, followed by a big green button marked “PAY NOW” and a countdown marked 02:16:58:28, ticking off seconds.
This has to be some kind of joke, she thought, stunned. Then, I can’t miss this meeting! She panicked, putting down her smoothie to rummage through her purse for her smartphone. I have to call them and let them know I’m running late.
Shit, she thought. I can’t unlock it, it’s paired with the WristLit.
She wouldn’t be able to communicate with anyone or leave her house until she paid to get all of the functions of the WristLit back. She put the phone down and looked back at the glaring red screen on her wrist.
She tapped “PAY NOW.”
The next screen already had all of her banking information, which was also conveniently stored on the WristLit for mobile payments. Next to it was the bitcoin equivalent of what they wanted her to pay, and another button that said “PAY NOW.”
The number made her eyes feel like they were going to bug out of her head.
That’s more than my college tuition and I’m still going to be paying that loan back for the rest of my life! This can’t be real. There’s no way people are paying that.
She could feel blood rushing to her face, and her pulse quickening as she started to really freak out. She could feel her heartbeat against the wrist band, which was becoming increasingly irritating. She tried scratching underneath it to lessen the pressure a little, but could barely fit a fingernail beneath it. And it seemed like the more she tried to pry it up, the tighter it got.
A red mark was already forming where it dug into her flesh.
There’s no way this is happening.
She tapped the WristLit’s screen to decline the payment and swiped to go back to the first message. But a different message appeared on the screen next to the countdown timer.
IF U DO NOT PAY U LOSE UR HAND.

Jo Baer, Untitled, 1972 via WikiArtThe lifestyle trend of minimalism seems like the perfect antidote to modern materialism. The average consumer sees 5,000 ads per day promising that products will bestow all kinds of happiness. Youth, beauty, success, social status, and a bevy of other pleasurable side effects are implied by advertising as being conferred upon consumption of new products, but there is always the same underlying message: you need more things to be happy.Minimalists disagree, and look to get more out of life with less stuff, a pursuit expressed as far back in time as the 18th century, when the Zen monk Ryōkan Taigu wrote the following poem:
I watch people in the world 
Throw away their lives lusting after things, 
Never able to satisfy their desires,
Falling into deeper despair
And torturing themselves.
Even if they get what they want
How long will they be able to enjoy it?
For one heavenly pleasure
They suffer ten torments of hell,
Binding themselves more firmly to the grindstone.
Such people are like monkeys
Frantically grasping for the moon in the water
And then falling into a whirlpool.
How endlessly those caught up in the floating world suffer.
Despite myself, I fret over them all night
And cannot staunch my flow of tears.
The modern world is much more complicated than Ryōkan's simple life having one bowl, one robe, and begging for food in the pursuit of enlightenment. In the 21st century, most people who aren't monks do need stuff to survive, as much as it may make him weep. The question is how much stuff exactly.The Minimalists"Minimalism is the thing that gets us past the things, so we can make room for life's most important things, which actually aren't things at all."Searches for "minimalism" spiked in January of 2017, following the release of Minimalism: A Documentary About The Important Things on Netflix. The film follows two men, Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, who teamed up in 2010 to launch a blog called The Minimalists. Since becoming The Minimalists in 2010, Millburn and Nicodemus have released over 150 podcasts, co-authored 3 books, and made countless media appearances espousing the gospel of minimalism. In an interview with GQ magazine, Millburn explained their philosophy in two sentences: "Minimalism is the thing that gets us past the things, so we can make room for life’s most important things, which actually aren’t things at all. Minimalism isn’t about deprivation, it’s about getting rid of the excess so we can focus and figure out what’s truly important."Both men have told and retold their stories of attaining success that was less than satisfying. They had "everything that was supposed to make us happy: six-figure careers, luxury cars, oversized houses, and all the stuff to clutter every corner of our consumer-driven lives," but were still struggling with debt, addiction, and disconnection from their families and personal passions. Millburn was the first convert, and by December of 2010 had whittled his possessions down to 288 things by giving away, selling, or trashing 90% of his possessions slowly over time. Nicodemus followed suit, ridding himself of 80% of his material things by the "packing party" method. It's not much of a party: you box up all of your belongings (which took Nicodemus and Millburn 9 hours) and only take things out when you need them. Everything still in boxes after three weeks is then deemed free to go.The benefits they advertise are too numerous to list. On The Minimalists site's introduction to the lifestyle's newcomers they have blog posts about minimalism's effect on relationships, career, budget, productivity, goal setting, decision making, mindfulness, free time, focus, health, and many more. Could the simple act of owning a tiny fraction of the things that the average household has (estimated at about 300,000 items) really make that much of a difference in every facet of one's life?The Life Changing MagicMarie Kondo certainly thinks so. The Japanese writer has sold 4 million copies of her 2014 book, The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Throughout the book, Kondo speaks of her obsession with organization throughout her whole life, and how the KonMari Method™ came to her in the form of a nervous breakdown. The key insight she gleaned from her own personal crisis about having too much, or the wrong stuff, is a philosophy that should work for anyone trying to minimize their life: instead of looking for things to throw away, using the KonMarie Method™, you decide on which things you will keep, on the basis of whether they "spark joy." Kondo's procedure begins by piling all your belongings for each category of things you own (i.e. clothes, papers, electronics) in one room, and then picking up and holding each item individually, to see whether it still inspires you. If it fails to produce a positive emotion, it shouldn't be something you own. Kondo spent many years attending a Shinto shrine, which explains the next step in the process: when an item leaves your life, or when you lovingly put it away, you should thank it for its service. This kind of animism regarding objects is not uncommon in eastern religions like Shinto and Buddhism, although Western readers may balk at saying "Thank you," out loud to a pair of worn out socks.Using this method, Kondo claims, will solve almost all of your life problems, because you will only be surrounded by things that bring you joy. What more could you need in your life if everything in your home gives you happiness?The Magic NumberKondo doesn't specify the number of things you should pare down to, so technically if everything in your house sparks joy, you can conscientiously keep all 300,000 of your possessions. But many minimalists stick to a magic number.Dave Bruno's book The 100 Things Challenge, published in 2010, documents his quest to figure that out by limiting himself to 100 objects, and he's not the only proponent of a minimalist lifestyle who counts every item, because every item counts. Colin Wright, one of the more famous gurus of minimalism, owns only 51 things, down from 72 in 2009, and not including consumables. His list includes his clothes, electronics, and some strange additional objects like a wine aerator – but it can be argued that well-decanted wine increases net happiness more than any other necessity.Leo Babauta of lifestyle blog Zen Habits wins the award for most minimalist lifestyle blog, including the URL: mnmlist.com, where he listed the 50 things he owned at one time, and now greets users with a 404 page haiku:
our search is lonely
a footprint left in pure snow
blown into nothing
Whittling down even more, the author of the blog Burger Abroad, Amanda, owns only 40 things, but she at least admits she's made some unique lifestyle choices to reach that point. First of all, she's a travelling house-sitter as her full-time job. She doesn't own any life accessories that are commonly found in the home because she uses other people's kitchens, bedrooms, and bathrooms. She only carries on luggage, so she's committed to a liquid-free and zero waste lifestyle and makes her own vegan bath and body products. For entertainment and exercise she says she walks a lot, and that "homes always have lots of entertainment, pets to love, and nature to be in."So if you can live out of other peoples' houses, minimalism is a fantastic lifestyle choice. Most of us were probably minimalists as children living in our parents' homes, before we developed our own tastes and sought the accumulation of things to define our personalities. The music, books, and clothing that we choose when we finally have the choice about how to adorn ourselves, decorate our spaces, and fill our leisure time becomes part of our identity. Even Steve Jobs, famous for his capsule wardrobe and minimalist approach to diet and lifestyle spent eight years trying to pick out a couch. Jo Baer, Untitled (Lipstick), 1972 via WikiArtOne critique of minimalism is that it's boring, that people express their personalities through the things they own and that every home ends up looking like Ikea or Muji if it only contains the bare necessities and a decorative succulent. The main critique is that it's a lifestyle choice that only appeals to people who could have an overabundance of stuff, which isn't the case for most of the world. It's a very privileged position to have access to the things you could need at any time, but to eschew them in favor of aesthetic purity. At its essence, minimalism is just another type of consumerism, that is defined by what isn't consumed. But in the modern world, we do have access to more things through technology. Instead of having a record collection or stack of DVDs on the shelf, Spotify and Netflix let you stream more music and movies than you would ever own, without committing to clutter for the rest of your life. Clothing, cars, and homes are more rented and shared than ever. Even the tech products themselves like laptops and smartphones that are necessary to access these services are available to use and then return when they're no longer needed.Zach Conway asked Joshua Millburn of The Minimalists how modern consumption habits tie into a minimalist lifestyle: "Up until now, a traditional life cycle meant we started families, bought a house, climbed the corporate ladder, and picked a date to retire. How do you think young people have changed this structure?" Millburn responded by saying he's heard people now have seven careers in their lifetime, and that the road map has changed. The Huffington Post's Highline article about how Millennials Are Screwed illustrates exactly why the next generation isn't buying houses, starting families, or staying in a single career (much less filling their homes with tons of stuff they'll never use). Nonetheless, whether or not the majority of people can afford the things that are supposed to make them happy is immaterial, when realizing that happiness from material things is superficial and fleeting. There is no exact number of things you need to be happy: but if there was, it would probably be less than you think.

In real life it’s hard enough to resist the urge to push on to the next milestone in a video game or put down a good book. But if you were immersed in a perfect virtual world — one with no external points of reference to remind you of "reality" – could you tear yourself away?</description?>

Make no mistake - VR is freakin' amazing. Even simple tools like Google Tilt Brush, are slaw-jawed-gawp-inducing astonishing, unlocking new concepts in your mind and causing users to utterly re-think something as fundamental as drawing.
So if by slipping on a VR headset we can zoom right back into a child-like mind state, discovering a world for the first time and getting juicy bursts of dopamine along the way, you can be sure we’ll find ways to stay inside our virtual spaces. But when does child-like enthusiasm become addiction?
It’s long been the subject of discussion among MDMA users: what happens when the real world, where you spend most of your time, can’t deliver the thrilling highs of Ecstasy World?
Video game addiction is no longer the punchline to a neckbeard joke - it’s real, and has been for a long time. Some estimates put the figure of video game addicts in the USA alone as high as 3 million. Remote, tech-free rehab centres in the wilderness help the most desperate recover.
Video games may or may not cause the kind of depression and addiction that would drive someone to stay in their room and spend hours grinding through menial virtual tasks, but games certainly do attract people who are susceptible to these things.

In video games, we’re safe to take risks, we can behave in ways we’d never dare on the high street, and we’re happy enough to die and start again.

Some never reach the point of being helped: after playing a game for 20 hours a day for nearly a month, one Russian gamer died from a thrombosis that formed as he played. Our bodies aren’t designed to cope with real-world inactivity while we pour endless time into virtual adventure.

Games are literally addictive partly because they’re designed to be amazing.
The games we love are the ones that allow us to live out our fantasies: scoring goals for Barcelona, being objectively better than our peers at shooting things, stealing cars and causing chaos. In video games, we’re safe to take risks, we can behave in ways we’d never dare on the high street, and we’re happy enough to die and start again.
The other factor in video games being literally addictive is, erm, due to them being specifically designed to be addictive. Our brains are hard-wired to self-reward when taking risks in small, progressive, successful steps - or, as we know them, levels, achievements, and high scores.
The squirt of dopamine that follows a successful mission in GTA 5 is what makes us justify the, “well, just one more go” feeling at 2 AM, when a cosy bed and sleep is calling. And software designers know exactly how to keep us in the feedback loop.
VR enthusiasts often use the word “immersive” to describe the experiences that their hardware and software provide.
For one, it sounds cooler and all-encompassing, but also hints at the true nature of the experience: you either can’t see the real world, or - in an augmented reality - you can’t see the joins.
So why would you want to unplug? Because if these immersive VR technologies are believable enough to train surgeons, you can be sure they’ll be good enough to convince you your preferred fantasy is real.
This is where, briefly, we plunge into perception itself: how we think and how we look at the world. Don’t worry - if you’ve ever sat in a university dorm, watched a friend take a hit from a bong and ask if the red you see is the same as the one they see - you’re in familiar territory.
If your assumption of visual perception is that light bounces off objects, enters your eyes, which then send signals to your brain, which then “looks” at the scene and makes sense of it, then, well, you are quite wrong.

Tallying desired input with actual input is a recipe for pleasure.

Research suggests that sensations - i.e. what you perceive when you look at an object - are barely based on visual input at all, but actually lean heavily on memory and mental predictions of what that object is. Think of it this way - when you read a book, are you studying every letter and word? Or do you run your eyes over the text and let your brain figure out what’s most likely being said?
So VR is tricking us in a subtle, wholly unexpected way. If our vision is actually the result of our brain projecting memories and fantasy onto images that enter the eyes, it’s easy to see how unadulterated joy will follow when you match believable virtual images with the desires of the brain itself.

Tallying desired input with actual input is a recipe for pleasure.
It’s possible to become neurologically addicted to online pornography, a medium which mentally and physically rewards the viewer in short, incremental spurts. Sites are designed to allow users to navigate to content that titillates them to their specific preference, and teases them to watch more.
The endless array of kinks, fetishes, and obscure twists on genres-within-genres that exist in online pornography - otherwise known as Rule 34 - are evidence of users’ desire for more of a very specific version of the same. And there are enough actors and producers to keep feeding that desire.
It seems unfathomable that designers of VR and AR experiences would approach the creation of their fantasy products any differently to how pornographers do: keep producing what people really, secretly want.
For now, virtual addiction doesn’t effect the vast majority of us. At some point during a gaming binge or a box-set marathon, the real world - an annoyed partner at the door, a crying baby, a work deadline - sidles into view, and the controller is put down.
But when your reality matches your fantasy, could you really switch off?

Last week, MONTAG published Part 1 of our 2019 predictions, tackling the tough questions like "Is the apocalypse finally, really, actually going to come this year? And what are we going to do about the climate if it doesn't?" We guessed at what corporate overlords like Amazon and Facebook will be up against in the coming year, and how your home, workplace, and commuting vehicle to travel betwixt them will all be embedded with tech.This week, we're zooming in on tech that you, personally, can look forward to buying, renting, or being bombarded with augmented reality advertisements for in the next year. What health tech innovations are going to medically assist the quest for eternal life? How are smartphones and computers going to advance leaps and bounds ahead of the devices at our fingertips now? And, most importantly, what are the trendiest beverages going to be?Skip to: Health TechSkip to: Smartphones & ComputingSkip to: Consumer Trends & EntertainmentSkip to: Miscellaneous PredictionsPeer once again into our crystal ball's swirling mists, and arm yourself with knowledge of the year ahead in tech.via GIPHYMay you live to be 100 years old: Health TechRay Kurzweil, who we rely heavily on as a predictor of the future based on his 1990 book The Age of Intelligent Machines, and 1999 publication, The Age of Spiritual Machines, made three specific predictions for the coming year. The first is that by 2019, average life expectancy will be 100 years. Kurzweil's second prediction was that wearable technology will be used for continuous diagnosis and preventative medicine, as well as providing treatment recommendations. And in a 2006 op-ed, Kurzweil stated, "By 2019, we will largely overcome the major diseases that kill 95 percent of us in the developed world, and we will be dramatically slowing and reversing the dozen or so processes that underlie aging."via GIPHYCentenarian status for all seems far off: the Pew Research Center estimates that by 2050, 3.7 million people globally will celebrate their hundredth birthday, 23.6 out of every 10,000 adults ages 65 or older – far from average, and another 30 years or so away. His second prediction, however, that wearable technology will provide a constant stream of data about our health, is coming true more and more with each iOS update. The inclusion of electrocardiogram data on the latest Apple Watch prompted the CEO of health tech startup Doc.AI, Walter De Brouwer, to speculate that "now is the ideal time," for live blood pressure monitoring and other advances in health features thanks to improvements in sensor technology and health data algorithms.The third prediction, that 95% of diseases will be eradicated, is unfortunately far too optimistic, with the United States recently suffering from their worst outbreaks in the 21st century of previously well-controlled diseases like measles, thanks to the anti-vaccination movement. However, both the director of the National Institutes of Health and Jennifer Doudna, a co-inventor of a gene editing technology using CRISPR, have pointed to advances in the understanding of genetic diseases leading to the eradication of sickle cell and disorders like muscular dystrophy, or at least some groundbreaking clinical trials, before 2020. So with preventable diseases returning, and new therapies developing for previously untreatable ones, 2019 hopefully maintains medical homeostasis.5G, folding phones, and contradictory predictions: Smartphones & ComputingTwo tech trends were predicted by the end of 2018 in the world of smartphones, and both were on display at CES 2019: foldable screens and 5G. Samsung leads the pack with their "Infinity Flex Display," first revealed at its 2018 developer conference, but if you really want to get a phone you can fold *now*, The Verge reviewed the "charmingly awful" Royole FlexPal, currently available in China for ¥8,999.While many vendors will boast 5G compatibility in devices hitting the market in 2019 and 2020, Sascha Geese, Head Geek at SolarWinds, says that the rollout will take longer than anticipated: "...many companies are claiming 5G-readiness, but without the infrastructure to support it, we’ll be left with the same bandwidth speed as before." Paul Carter, CEO of Global Wireless Solutions, also predicts its adoption will be restricted by existing infrastructure: "The reality is that it’s not an instantaneous transition, we will have a blended network of 5G, 4G and even 3G, depending upon geography." Fortune says early adopters will be "punished with short battery life and iffy reception," and several sources predict the first 5G iPhone likely won't be available until 2020.via GIPHYThe future of computing is full of contradictions. At CES 2019, Nvidia's CEO declared that Moore's Law is no longer applicable, while IBM at the same event unveiled a quantum computer for commercial use. So while computers are advancing more slowly, they could be edging towards the precipice of the quantum revolution.For consumer devices, there are also two possible futurescapes that are appearing simultaneously: ubiquitous computing and virtual reality. Mark Weiser, who coined the term "ubiquitous computing" in 1988, put the two movements at odds: "Ubiquitous computing is roughly the opposite of virtual reality. Where virtual reality puts people inside a computer-generated world, ubiquitous computing forces the computer to live out here in the world with people." Kurzweil predicted a bit of both, with computers embedded everywhere in the environment, as well as heads-up displays that could overlay or completely block out the physical world with virtual artefacts. With Facebook, Google, and Microsoft all working on more portable headsets and virtual reality displays, and Internet of Things devices on display at CES including bottle openers, mirrors, fishing rods, and litter boxes, even a "smart" plank of wood, these two diametrically opposed paradigms are set to collide in 2019, and we're sure to see much of both in the coming year.Clickbait, e-sports, and... more clickbait: Consumer Trends & Entertainment When compiling this list of 2019 predictions for the year, we found several Twitter accounts making bold claims of events sure to happen in the world of pop culture and entertainment: @Predict_2019 says cryptically that "A current boy band will break up," (very likely, but which one?!),  @19predictions ominously states, "watch yourself, bieber,"  @2019_predicts intones "Another royal baby," @2k19predict takes a stab with "Lots of visual albums coming this year," and @2019thoughts blasphemes by claiming in 2019, "Betty White will die."But if Betty White doesn't get live to 100, this future blows.via GIPHYThe much more reliable seers at Fortune and TechSpot have predicted that for 2019 in entertainment, it's all about e-sports. Over 100 million viewers are expected to tune in to the 2019 League of Legends world championship, and e-sports viewing as a whole will crush prime time cable television, which is already on its way out thanks to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. Other major televised events expected to draw a record-breaking crowd include the Women's World Cup, with 800 million viewers, and the Cricket World Cup, captivating 2 billion viewers across the globe.TikTok, the short video sharing app created by China's ByteDance, potentially the largest valued startup in the world at $75 billion as of October 2018, shows no signs of slowing down with 500 million global users in 150 countries at the end of last year.

Blockchain, beverages, & baby namesDespite the price graphs for Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies resembling the trajectory of a slinky on a set of stairs, some still believe that after most of the alt-coins and scams that popped up during the 2017-18 bubble have run their course, Bitcoin will rise again. TrendHunter reports that other applications of blockchain besides cryptocurrencies, including social applications and offshoots of cryptocurrency culture in sectors like the art world, will also flourish despite the currencies' weak prospects as stores of monetary value.In the food and beverage markets, TrendHunter singles out watermelon seeds as the next trendy superfood, and edible 3D prints as the next gourmet fad. The first one is so random it just might work, if consumers can overcome the childhood fear of a watermelon growing inside of their stomachs, and the second is a sure thing. Although "extruded food" doesn't sound the most appetizing, one of the most exciting applications is to create new pasta shapes, combining elegant curvature with optimal saucing:Pair 3-D printed pasta with a glass of wine, and if you really want to be ahead of the trends, pick an orange wine over a rosé. Lastly, the trends that will haunt an entire generation, trendy baby names for 2019. We bring you the best of the worst, starting with food names: "Kiwi" and "Kale," no kidding, are up 40% and 35% in popularity according to BabyCenter, and while non-binary baby names are very cool, abstract concepts like "Justice," "Journey," and "Royal" seem like hard names to live up to. The last trend seems too weird to be true, that sneakerheads are taking inspiration from their kicks in naming their kids "Chuck," "Taylor," "Van," and "Jordan," but if there's anything we know for certain about the year to come, it's that nothing will surprise us. via GIPHYPerhaps in 2037, as the Kiwis and Kales of this year cross the holographic platform at their virtual reality high schools to accept their diplomas, we will look back on these predictions and laugh. But for now, with the future still looking somewhat uncertain, this is the best we can advice we can give: don't name your baby after a shoe.

One very important thought
Quickly, think of something really specific you have taken a photo of. Now Google it. Has it, or something incredibly similar, been documented and uploaded by other people already? SPOILER: it almost certainly has been, many, many times. How do you feel about that? Does it devalue your image? Why did you even take the picture in the first place?
Rules 21 -24, inclusive
You’re possibly familiar with Rule of The Internet #34: “If you can think of it, there is porn of it, no exceptions.”
This famous, and yet-to-be-convincingly-disproven truism comes from the not-as-funny-as-it-should-be Rules Of The Internet, which like everything funny-weird that emerged from the internet between 2003 and 2010, originated on the notorious 4chan messageboard.
Lesser-known is literally every other Rule on the list, but amongst the unamusing in-jokes and references to My Little Ponies, Chuck Norris and the pool being closed is a little spurt of rules that have proven incredibly prescient since they were first written in 2006:

Original content is original only for a few seconds before getting old.
Copy 'n paste is made to ruin every last bit of originality.
Copy 'n paste is made to ruin every last bit of originality.
Every repost is always a repost of a repost.

What these rules recognise is a truth that all of us have discovered in one way or another since our lives drifted online. To wit: everything you share online has been done before. Every joke, every meme, every observation, every photo - there’s an infinitesimally small chance that you’re the first to upload it.
Today, being online is a little bit like stepping into The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy’s Total Perspective Vortex machine, which destroys the minds of its victims by showing them an immersive VR scale model of the entire universe and “a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot bearing the legend "you are here”.”

A picture is worth a thousandth of a word
Photography is one of the most popular ways for people spend their Play time. Even if you don’t consider yourself a photographer, you have thousands of photos squirrelled away somewhere. And of all the things we share online, we’re most keen to get our photos out there.
Let’s look at just one app: Instagram. 95 million photos and videos are shared on Instagram per day, and over 40 billion photos and videos have been shared on Instagram since it launched.
There are over 282 million selfies on Instagram. Pizza is the most photographed food, and there are just under a million photos tagged #avocadotoast on Instagram.
People are so keen to take photos of their food before they eat it, restaurants are making their food more colourful and neatly-arranged to encourage their food to go viral on the ‘gram.
So not only are the awful people who whip out their DSLR to snap an artful photo of their rapidly-cooling meal ruining the vibe of your favourite eatery, they’re causing the chef to prioritise style over substance in your food. And the dumbest thing is that they could have just focussed on enjoying their food in the moment, because they could most likely find a nice picture of the exact thing they just ate online on the bus ride home.
It’s all a bit dispiriting. Have we uploaded our way into a world where nothing’s worth photographing? Should we should just… give up taking photos? What can we do that’s new?

Interval: A list of things to photograph which guarantee the fresh unique subject matter you desire
MONTAG put its team of Key Thought Leaders to work to come up with ideas of things that you can gaily snap away at, safe in the knowledge that you’ll be capturing something brand new and people will gasp in amazement in your wake. The bad news is that all these photos would be either will-snappingly boring, or stupendously expensive.
📸 Screenshots of your computer screen glitching or TV screen interference freak-outs. (Or, most likely, the “Berliner Fenster” screens on the U-bahn, which seem to be permanently glitching out in order to mess with the heads of hungover commuters) There’s nothing more unique than the most delicious of screen glitches.
📸 There are plenty of incredibly ugly deep-sea fish with big dangly light-up parts and dozens of rows of teeth that have not been discovered yet - go and load up your bathyspheres (It doesn’t have to be ugly fish - last week scientists discovered a brand new hot pink and acid yellow neon-coloured fish - truly MONTAG’s spirit animal).
📸 Fast, winding rivers: because they’re continually changing shape as the water gnaws away it the riverbanks, if only very slightly.
📸 See also: Glaciers - technically, they are always slightly moving and changing. All new, all the time!
📸 According to conspiracy theorists, the earth itself has not been photographed yet, so drop Elon a line and see if he’ll pop you on his moon rocket.
📸 Finally, it turns out there is a never-ending production line of brand new things waiting to be photographed that have never been photographed before: dead people’s corpses! Nothing says “unique” like that first snap of a stiff. Make friends with your local mortician!

Every repost is always a repost of a repost
The internet has forced a tangible smoothing-out of culture: news, ideas and images travel so fast, they have no time to fester, in-breed and mutate in pockets any more.
It’s hard, for instance, to imagine a bizarre niche creative subculture like, I dunno, Gabber - a crazed ultra-fast-BPM sub-set of techno - happening now, simply because the idea would spread so far and so fast, it would be either subsumed by all similar music, laughed out of existence, or copied by everyone instantly, rendering its uniqueness inert.
The same goes for photography: it turns out everyone has always been taking the same photos of everything as everyone else. But that was fine - we were all atomised from each other, so it was only you who caught that airplane flying in front of the moon.
Then the internet came along and we discovered how unoriginal we all are. And then how did we respond? We started seeing images we liked, and copying them - deliberately composing identical images.
You’ve already likely done it in a good-clean-fun-for-all-the-family way: who hasn’t looked at the Leaning Tower Of Pisa and felt an urge to take this photo?
But there is a subtler, more insidious side to the human need to Pisa-pose. We’re making exactly the same images for everything we do.
@Instarepeat is a collection of the most fabulously mediocre visual tropes - hosted on Instagram, of course. Greatest hits include: the holding-hands-with-woman-who’s-walking-ahead photo, the utterly incomprehensible vertical-phone-in-the-wild photo and the classic that is yr-bb-moodily-rowing-a-boat.
Emma Sheffer, who runs the @instarepeat account, made a telling observation to website Hyperallergic: “I think we all constantly see imagery pop up around us that is familiar, but on Instagram it seems to be almost encouraged by the monetization of popularity.”
In other words, the motivation to take the photo isn’t simply just because it’s a nice-looking or cleverly-composed photo you’ve seen somewhere else - it aligns you, the photographer, with the kind of people who take that photo. You are a person who carefully curates how the world sees your life. You are happy to be the same as everyone else, but at least you’re carefully arranged; like a Nike ad or a Youtube pre-roll video.
This practice is a short cut to artfulness, but also expedites a larger law of diminishing returns for all photographers. As arch-blogger Jason Kotkke put it, “taking a photo of a friend holding up the Leaning Tower of Pisa or jumping in the middle of the road in Utah are really good ideas — that’s why lots of people do it — but each successive photo of the same thing doesn’t tell us anything new about those places, experiences, or people.”
So in a culturally super-smoothed time, where so many photos are the similar, are all photos now cliches? Has the entire world and the entire human experience been captured? And if so, why don’t we just outsource the process?



Foto-Automat
Vermöladen is a made-up word taken from The Dictionary Of Obscure Sorrows, describing the fear that the amazing photo you are about to take already exists. It’s a type of hopeless frustration, unique to our time. Here’s the full definition:
vemödalen – n. the frustration of photographing something amazing when thousands of identical photos already exist–the same sunset, the same waterfall, the same curve of a hip, the same closeup of an eye–which can turn a unique subject into something hollow and pulpy and cheap, like a mass-produced piece of furniture you happen to have assembled yourself.
The subtext of Vermöladen says we shouldn’t actually worry about originality: it’s all been done before, all of it, every last bit - and that should be of comfort to us all.
To which MONTAG says: nonsense. We should instead re-think why we’re photographing at all. And how we’re photographing, and why we even need to have role in the process.
As Picasso showed by mastering the traditional art of painting by the age of 15, once you’ve done it all, you need to go somewhere else and start again. Picasso didn’t keep painting in the manner of Leonardo - instead he embraced the world around him, looked at it differently, and got busy creating cubism.
Every sharp-suited marketing manager’s favourite blogger, Seth Godin, said, “Just about every successful initiative and project starts from a place of replication. The chances of being fundamentally out of the box over the top omg original are close to being zero. A better question to ask is, "have you ever done this before?" Or perhaps, "are the people you are seeking to serve going to be bored by this?””
So why share your photo of the same-old-same old. What are you adding to the diaspora? Instead, why not let your phone do all the work for you, and you can spend your time on holiday living in the moment instead of viewing Vienna through your phone screen.
via GIPHY
Neo-Photography
MONTAG’s suggestion is as follows. Feel free to filcher, app developers, because this startup idea is a #Unicorn-in-waiting.
Seeing as your phone knows every place you have ever been, why don’t we create an app that figures out everywhere you go, cross reference your geo-location with photo-dumps like Flickr, and create a little bundle of the most popular photos in the exact locations you were in, selectively superimposing you into some of them as if you took selfies?
It’d mean that your “holiday snaps”, featuring all the best (and, remember, popular) things you saw would silently and magically appear in your photo stream and be posted onto the ‘Gram without you ever taking your camera out of your pocket.
And then you could spend your fraction-of-a-fraction-of-a-moment on the planet experiencing it first hand, instead of spending your time documenting it.

One school of thought states that the motivation behind much of our normal behaviour – taking photographs, getting married – is essentially a stab at immortality: a way of creating witnesses to the tiny dent we made in the universe.
As we've discussed on MONTAG before, one day we may well become immortal (at least, in the eyes of everyone else) but until then, in the spirit of futurism, shouldn't we be finding better ways to dispose of ourselves?
Kathryn Lawrence found that our traditional "burn or bury" options seem a little dated when you could be heated to thousands of degrees, squashed to thousands of atmospheres, or blasted thousands of kilometres away...

There's a German phrase akin to the aphorism "You can't take it with you": "Das letzte Hemd hat keine Taschen." Literally, "the last shirt has no pockets."
Both expressions refer to the morbid reality that even though we spend so much of our lives accumulating material possessions and caring for our bodies, the great equalizer, death, does not allow us to keep these things – in Western cultures, that is.
Most people are familiar with Egyptian burial practices, in which effigies of the dead's material belongings (and even their pets), were included in the burial so they could accompany them to the next life. Offering grave goods such as "hell money," fake cash burnt as offerings to one's ancestors, is still a very common practice in Asia. And the tradition of leaving coins on the eyes or in the mouth of the deceased in order to pay for the ferry into the underworld goes back to ancient Greece.
But in the modern Western world, we have no such transference of material goods into the afterlife (if you even believe in one). What we do have are a bunch of new practices to figure out what to do with what you leave behind: how do you want to recycle your personal carbon?

Shoot For The Stars
One of the first science fiction writers to propose burial in space was Neil Ronald Jones. In  "The Jameson Satellite," first published in 1931's Amazing Stories, a scientist named Professor Jameson seeks to preserve his body by sending it on a satellite, and is revived by interplanetary visitors millions of years afterwards.

Established in 1994, Celestis memorial spaceflights has made this science fiction dream a reality, but they won't send your entire body to be revived by aliens in the far future. What they can do is launch "a symbolic portion" of cremated remains into space with a commercial or scientific satellite.
Celestis offers several different space burial packages: the Earth Rise, for $1,295, flies you up far enough to experience zero gravity and then come back down (much like the Zero Gravity Flights parabolic flight experience, but with significantly less chance of vomiting).
The Earth Orbit package, for $4,995, shoots you into the atmosphere where you will later "harmlessly vaporize like a shooting star in final tribute" upon re-entry. The Luna Service and Voyager Service both cost $12,500 and Luna will land you on the moon, whereas Voyager will let you go further: both programs are the same price because they ride along with capsules that are being sent to the moon or deep space for scientific purposes anyway.
Friends and family are invited to view the memorial launch, and if they can't attend, a live, global webcast of the launch is also available.
Celestis DNA is also available to those who do not choose cremation. They send a cheek swab up instead, and this program seems to be not only for memorial purposes, as one of the advertised benefits is "off-planet DNA storage and preservation," – so the Jameson Project's goal is not so far off.
Perhaps if an alien race were to harvest some of your DNA out of a satellite remaining in the Earth's atmosphere, you could be revived via cloning. Arthur C. Clarke provided a strand of his hair as a DNA sample for a Celestis flight in 1999, and is quoted upon supplying the donation, "I'd give you more, but I don't have anything to spare."

Another company named Elysium Space launched in 2013, offers a similar space-burial service for $1,990. They also provide loved ones with an app that can track your memorial satellite as it traverses the Earth's atmosphere in real time.
In 2014, Celestis launched Celestis Pets, and they have stated that any inclusion of animal remains before this point was in violation of their policy, after it was rumored that the ashes of  Bismarck, a police dog from Monroe, Washington were stowed away on a 2012 flight.
Several notable individuals have already been buried in space. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and James Doohan, the original Scotty from Star Trek, who passed in 2005, are both in Earth orbit along with American psychedelic philosopher Timothy Leary.
Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, an astronomer famed for co-discovering the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Comet, rests on the moon. And Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto, was sent into deep space on the New Horizons craft, the first to pass by and photograph the now-demoted dwarf planet that he called "Planet X."
In 2012, a delegate from the state of Virginia  proposed  tax breaks for space burials, but the policy looks like it didn't make the books.
However, as space flight gets cheaper and more commonplace due to Elon Musk's relentless drive to return to his home planet – and the rest of us fleeing the consequences of global warming or other man-made Earth-bound catastrophes – many more people may choose their final resting place off-world.




Shine Bright Like A Diamond



Another increasingly popular transmutation of the human body is compression into a diamond after cremation. Several companies such as Cremation Solutions, LifeGem, Heart in Diamond, and Algordanza offer this service.

The human body is 18% carbon. 2% of this carbon remains after cremation, and it is this carbon that Algordanza uses to make their diamonds

Cremation Solutions' website explains the process:

Step 1: Place several ounces of the ashes in a crucible that can withstand massive heat.
Step 2: Bring the temperature to just over 5,000 degrees fahrenheit, and allow all of the elements except the carbon to oxidize.
Step 3: Continue to heat until the carbon has turned to graphite. The entire heating process will take a few weeks.
Step 4: Place the graphite in a core with a metal catalyst and a diamond seed crystal.
Step 5: Place the core in a diamond press.
Step 6: Bring the temperature to about 2,500 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure to about 800,000 pounds per square inch. Allow several weeks for the graphite to turn into a rough crystal.
Step 7: Remove the crystal and use faceting tools to cut it to your specifications.

Both Cremation Solutions and Heart in Diamond emphasize that while these synthetic diamonds have all the natural properties of a girl's best friend, they are more kind to the earth and lack the exploitative labor practices of diamond mining to produce.
Depending on color, cut, clarity, and carat size, individual diamonds go from $750 to $24,999, and that's only for the diamond, not including the setting or jewelry.
While some synthetic diamond creation processes allow for the addition of chemicals to color the diamond, Algordanza's process uses the natural beauty of the boron content of the deceased's ashes to bring out the color, which can range from white to dark blue.
And is this process also available for pets? You bet.

"LifeGem for Pets? Of course."
At LifeGem, we understand that pets are cherished companions and unconditionally loving family members. Since introducing the LifeGem to the world, we have received thousands of requests to memorialize pets as LifeGems. The answer is YES, we absolutely can and will create a LifeGem memorial of your precious pet.


Something's Gonna Steal Your Carbon
Can't decide between cremation and giving your body back to the Earth the old fashioned way? A Swedish process called  Promession offers an eco-friendly alternative.
Invented by biologist and avid gardener Susanne Wiigh-Mäsak, the promession process involves freezing the body using liquid nitrogen to a temperature of -196º C, and then using powerful vibrations to break it into a fine powder. The powder is then freeze-dried again and processed to remove any metals that are remaining in the mixture from prosthetics, tooth fillings, or other bits that could harm the soil.
This powdered and reduced substance is then placed in a biodegradable container and buried shallowly so that the remaining minerals are in contact with the topsoil and are readily available for plant life. Between six to eighteen months later, the container and all of the materials it contains will have been recycled.
Wired reported on the process back in 2013, and uncovered conflicting information as to its effectiveness: while it was tested extensively on pigs, its use for humans has yet to be proven since human testing is still illegal, and a source from the Federation of Cemeteries and Crematoria of Sweden claimed that some deceased people who intended to use the process have had their bodies frozen for 10 years and are still waiting to be promessed.


"Capsula Mundi" via New York Post

In the mean time, people are still coming up with interesting, eco-friendly ways to use the human body to nourish the Earth. The "Capsula Mundi", created by Italian designers Anna Citelli and Raoul Bretzel looks like an egg, and envisions a future where cemeteries would consist of hundreds of trees being nourished by seed pods containing human remains.

Of course there's no cure for death that we know of (yet) but who knows what the future may hold?
Those people who are currently frozen and waiting to be involved in a more eco-friendly burial process, could be on the first step to cryogenics, which would make the Jameson Project a reality without spaceflight: reviving the terminally ill from a frozen state of stasis when a cure has been found for their disease.
Until then, becoming a shooting star, a shiny rock, or plant food are all pretty cool options as something to do with what you leave behind. You can't take it with you, but giving is always better than taking, anyway.

What was once called "online life" is just "normal life" now. Life is funneled through our phones, laptops, and wearables: an incredibly detailed, annotated, timestamped diary that we unwittingly complete every minute of every day. But how permanent is your online trail?
If you wanted to go completely off the grid, how difficult would it be? It's incredibly difficult to completely disconnect from your online identity – or is it? In Part One of a look into what anonymity means in today’s society,  Kathryn Lawrence explains what technology you need to use to disappear completely...


“Many, many years ago, so long ago that it’s a real stretch to find anyone else who can remember this, on the old Oprah show, she did a feature on individuals who had left society and, in the process, had eliminated every trace of themselves. She had like three or four guests up on stage, if I recall correctly, and they had all gone back and diligently destroyed every little bit of information previously known about them. Burning birth certificates and ID cards, canceling bank accounts. Stealing photos out of family member’s albums and destroying them. They had hired hackers to break into schools and erase their records.


"In fact, each of these persons had done such a bang-up job that all that was known about each of them was their social security numbers. (Although Oprah’s researchers were unable to say which social belonged to which person; these numbers were only known because of the noticeable gaps that were left in the government’s records.) On the program, these people sat in the dark; nameless and unsorted. No one knew who they were."

Uber has recently been embroiled in a series of scandals.
First, it was regarding sexual harassment in their offices, then fair pay for their workers on the road, followed by hidden programs designed to evade regulation – and most recently, their use of a rival's customer data. A recent New York Times profile of Uber’s founder revealed that they were using data mined by a web service called Unroll.me – a free service that was too good to be true.
Unroll.me combs through your email, finds services you’re subscribed to, and then unsubscribes from them for you, so that you can easily tidy up your digital presence. What they didn’t tell users (except in fine print in their terms of service) is that a lot of data about you found whilst combing through emails would then be available for sale.
For Uber, this was really useful: they could look at anonymised receipts from their rival ride-sharing business, Lyft. The users of Unroll.me didn’t find this so edifying, and a media uproar followed.
Whatever the moral quandary around data use, several other similar services exist, revealing a thriving market of people who want to delete their personal data wherever they can on the internet.
For instance: Deseat.me is an almost identical service to Unroll.me; Gmail Unsubscribe is another. Another, paid, service called DeleteMe will check the sites it deletes your data from periodically to be sure that your information hasn’t been recovered after "deletion".
People want to disappear; at least a little bit. But how?





"Nowadays we would label this kind of act as ‘information suicide’ or something very sophisticated, because people are much more aware of the importance of ones’ identities, but in those days we simply called it ‘jerktoasting’ and these people on the stage were just a few jerktoasters who got caught. We were fascinated by them, because no one of us had ever thought of deleting ourselves. It seemed futuristic to do so and it seemed to exhibit willful antipathy to do so, which, in a way, somehow seems quite futuristic as well.”

What does it take to commit “infosuicide”?
And where should you start if you want to begin to disappear? It might be easier to make a difference than you think. Here's how you could do it...
No E-Commerce
Your real identity and your financial services are inextricably intertwined. So the first thing you would need to do is remove any and all banking information from the internet. That means no online banking, no PayPal, no Amazon or any other e-commerce websites, and no Netflix (if you pay for Netflix). A service like Cancel Wizard can actually go through some of these processes for you (for a fee).
No Social Media
This one seems fairly obvious, but any place where you have pictures of yourself can be found by reverse image search. Completely deleting Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, and all of the others isn’t exactly made easy, but the data you create there is worth its weight in gold.
Sometimes it can be fun to dig into your old Myspace, Livejournal, or Xanga, but it’s also nice to know those old pictures or online diary entries won’t come back to haunt you. The services Just Delete Me and Account Killer rank sites by how difficult they are to remove your personal information from.
Even if you use a nickname that you think isn’t connected to your real identity in any way, it only takes one website’s lack of privacy to connect someone to every account where you use that same username.
Delete Yourself From Data Collection Sites
This CNET tutorial advises that you can look up your personal information on data brokers’ sites like Whitepages and Peoplefinder and individually request their deletion, but they also note that sometimes this requires filing actual paperwork.
This is where having a paid service like DeleteMe, who will do the web scouring for you, comes in handy. If you really want to do it all manually, a Reddit user compiled this list of the most commonly used background checking sites.
Contact Webmasters and Remove Your Domains
Google provides a handy list of web services they run that you can formally request having your information removed from, including the platforms Blogger/Blogspot, Google Drive, and YouTube. If you’ve ever owned a web domain, you should check the WhoIs databases to be sure that your phone number, address, email address, or any other personal info isn’t being saved and served to anyone.

Blast the Cache
Even if your information has been removed from the current version of a website, the cache is king. Google lists several reasons on its troubleshooting page that they may deny your request to remove a cached version of a page, and services like the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine retain cached versions of web pages for posterity and as a historical imperative.
There’s not much you can do about these, unless you go back to the previous step, look up the webmaster’s WhoIs data, and contact them directly with a request to purge your information from the cache.
and finally... Delete Your Email Address
Getting rid of all of these other services will most likely require having access to your email address, so this should be the last step. And possibly the hardest - although if you've seen the above process through this far, maybe it'll actually be an easy decision.

What will you do when you remove yourself from the Internet?
Discard your phone and read books or write letters instead? Eschew the VR headset and strike up conversation with strangers on public transport? Live like the Amish? Whittle sticks and slowly rock in a chair on your porch?
Can the modern person even exist off the internet grid entirely?

Next week, in Part Two, Kathryn finds out about life after you disappear completely from the web, and tells the fascinating story of a legendary developer who completely vanished from the internet – only to  suddenly reappear years later.


”Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option” - Professor Stephen Hawking

In the future, money, earning, and buying is going to be fundamentally different. The value of things will change: ownership of things may shrink away (you can try out an owning-free life today) and money itself may be valued differently. We compare missives from a fictional future with the steps being taken today to get there...

Yearning for earning
In this version of the future, there are no alarm-clocks. There are no radio-alarms, wake-you-gently “sunrise” lamps, buzzers, bells, or novelty branded waking devices.
You are woken up by birdsong, or your children, or your dog, or because you are hungry. And maybe breakfast is your hardest decision of the day. Because in this version of the future, you don’t need to work anymore.
When automation started replacing manufacturing and driving jobs, people got worried; when, in 2025, AI made automation more efficient than humans could dream of, a whole other chunk of jobs vanished too, and people panicked.
Not everyone could do a non-automatable job: there are only so many artisan wood-turners, rustic bakers, and talking therapists a society needs (although the latter did get a lot more work.)
Yet when UBI - Universal Basic Income - was introduced in 2027, and everyone was guaranteed a minimum income, the wild celebration was initially tempered with both personal and social unease. A society who’d learnt that hard work was righteous and no work was laziness was suddenly grouped together en mass, with limitless free time. Of course, the borders had to be secured immediately: everyone wanted a piece.
But increased security enforcement was literally a small price to pay for the fulfilment of a fundamental human dream: no work, all play.

via GIPHY
Universal Boredom
As we peer over the horizon, the idea of a Universal Basic Income is increasingly plausible. Every time Tesla or Google or Boston Dynamics demonstrates a new dazzling piece of technology, time is called on another job sector: ta-ta, truckers; goodnight writers; adios warehouse workers.
And yet today it’s hard to imagine governments even beginning to consider UBI, even though it’s clear that the oncoming tidal wave of unemployment might force their hands. The main sticking points seem to be: why should we pay all of society’s lazy bums to do nothing? And what will I do if I don’t have a job any more?
The first point ignores the fact that when UBI is introduced, the likelihood is that we will all be as busy as these lazy bums; the second point is the act of looking a gift horse in the mouth.
Yannis Varoufakis, famed economist and former Greek finance minister, is blunt. Capitalism is “ending because it made itself obsolete” through its own tech advances. He argues that we have hitched our wagon to this strain of capitalism: our wages, mortgages, expenditure - everything - is centred around the capitalist idea of growth and new consumption.
And now the result of it all - automation - might stop that very same system in its tracks.

"We can all become rich-lazy, and accept our latent human desire to not do very much whatsoever."

Varoufakis views UBI in broader terms: as the rebalancing of long-term investments. Prise open a mobile phone, says Yannis, and you’ll find a variety of components and parts - and, “every single technology in it was developed by some government grant.” WiFi, for instance, was invented by a branch of the Australian government - who own the patent and get paid for each device sold.
He says that UBI can be thought of as a dividend - a return for these investments by the state from which big companies got rich.
And the lazy bums? Yannis says that our feelings of unfairness - the lazy get the same UBI as us hard-working types - misses a bigger societal concern. By acknowledging, he says, that “the right to laziness has traditionally been only for the propertied rich,” we can view the world with a new perspective. Instead of demonising the poor for laziness, we can all become rich-lazy, and accepting of our latent human desires to not do very much whatsoever.
He has a point: if humans no longer need to work, we shouldn’t, if we don’t want to - and this choice is a sign of our technological and societal improvement.
In the meantime, Google has launched a rather generous-sounding billion-dollar “Grow with Google” scheme which educates people for free. The reason you should educate yourself is, essentially, to prepare for your current skills being made obsolete faster than you can imagine - or as Google puts it:

“We know that people are changing the world through their own creativity and passion and that sometimes technology lends a hand.”

A quick, erm, Google search reveals a slew of to-the-point headlines like “Google pledges $1 billion to prepare workers for automation.”
Why not sign up - you might need something to do with your time soon, right?

Time waits for everyone
If time = money, what do you do when you have all the money in the world? Initially, it was fun: the clubs and bars boomed, open 24 hours a day, fuelling partygoers who never ran out of credit.
The UBI is paid each month: a virtual transaction to a virtual account of a virtual government cryptocurrency you have never held in your hand, but transfer between one another all the time. For most of us, days are… easy. Childcare issues have gone. Family time has increased. Crime and violence has dipped significantly: plentifulness abounds. Book sales have shot up: people are much better read now.
Of course the super-rich still exist, still making payments in old fiat currencies. But those dollars and pounds circulate between them, as they buy the same string of yachts, supercars and jewels. The money doesn’t leave the circle, except when expensive and hastily bought gifts disappear with a beautiful (and, not turns out, cunning) ex-partner.
And after the fun, it got a bit… dull. Pleasant but boring. Like Soma. Hobbies got big. Rock climbing was particularly popular - maybe it was the sensation of ascending past other people.

Free Time might be exactly that: gratis. There will be plenty of people who still work: some who need to, some who want to, some who just can’t let the idea of more money go. But plenty will be happy on their UBI. So how to fill the time?
Automation and AI will drive prices of technology down (note that in a post-UBI world, “cost” is a very relative term), whilst boosting its capabilities. So it could be easy to get lost in VR, or in AR, or in games, or in all of the above: living out fantasies in a fantasy parallel world.
Of course, you’re probably planning to be one of the slightly pious ones who’ll, like, totally not be into VR.
But just wait until you have all the time you need, and all the VR fantasies you want: see how appealing the tofu-making course you off-handedly signed up for seems them.

via GIPHY
Untying from buying
Shopping stopped being a past time and drifted into a necessity. So the people who worked were the people who just couldn’t let go of the dirty thrill of purchasing. They have jobs that are lucky enough to be thusfar unautomated or, for the desperate, could find.
But after a generation or so, the National Board predicts that this now-weird need to purchase will fade, and already there are so many ways to share amazing tech: cars, objects, entertainment.
Why would we want to clutter up our lives with things we only use for 10% of the time? Since disbanding the old government system, the National Board has worked hard to keep everyone happy within the UBI system, and we’re all sharing the benefits of the wise investments made by the old governments.

Rejecting ownership and accepting UBI are bedfellows, in a way. It makes more sense when you look at it from this perspective: Big companies “own” fewer of us today than ever before; so it’s normal that we should have less of their stuff too. In the mid Sixties, the most valuable company in the US was AT&T, and they employed over three-quarters of million people. Today, the most valuable company is Google, and they employ about 55,000 people.
Google’s actually worth more, allowing for inflation, than AT&T was. So where does all that extra money go? It’s sloshing around somewhere, and UBI’s credo is not that it should come to us, but that it must, to allow these companies to continue their success - and yet, we won’t want to buy their stuff any more.
We’re already looking at ownership differently. It’s partly via necessity - Generation Rent simply can’t afford to buy a house in certain cities - and it’s partly because of convenience. The by-the hour car rental model and Airbnb's by-the-day rental model, is considered not only normal, but a no-brainer.
Extending this ethos to all of the objects you now own might not sound like much fun for manufacturers. They've got wealthy off releasing a new model of Device X every six months, but our perception of ownership has changed.
When our perception of money is completely different and UBI brings utter security, the idea of permanently investing into things will be a choice; a hobby.

So are there even disadvantages of non-ownership? Maybe: there is an argument that non-ownership affects the perception of the experience because you have not invested substantially into the object.
Today, few people buy music physically; instead they stream it when they want it. And think about how this on-demand system affects your music choices: if you didn’t “get” a certain album immediately on Spotify, would you persevere listening to it until you finally understood it? Or would you skip to something else?
Alternatively, if you’d paid €25 for a double heavyweight vinyl version of that “difficult” album, you’d be more likely to dig into it out of a sense of investment.
And yet, ownership actually holds consumers back: once you have invested, you must wait before you can invest again, and other avenues of exploration and discovery are closed. The music streaming perspective is a useful analogy once again: how much more music have you discovered since streaming became normal? Has your experience, your life, your understanding been broadened as a result of this endless choice, this sense of shifting around?
And this is maybe, vaguely, is how using money will feel in the near future: we’ll be richer in experiential terms, just as long as we’re in control of our own impulses. We’ll care less about ownership of things, except for a very few, special, select cases that are highly important to us. And we’ll learn be happy with the idea of everyone being on hand-outs, just so long as we can be comfortable with us being on them too.
Your future might be lazy, mindful, and enriched. Or it might be lazy, listless, and restless. Whatever it is, it’ll be lazy. Time to embrace your inner slob.

Right now, the promise of cutting-edge VR experiences appears to be in creating immersive video games. But VR allows for much more subtle experiences that are yet a lot more fundamental in scope.
Google Tilt Brush is a breathtaking example of VR technology that you can try at home with an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. It makes one enormous step-change to something you’ve been doing since before you could talk: drawing. And as soon as you use it, you’ll realise you can’t ever go back to pencil and paper.

This is a story of varying philosophical depths. It’s a story about cutting-edge technology. A story about re-thinking the physical connection you have with the universe. Re-evaluating how you interact with our four dimensions. About discovering new ways to intuitively create beauty.
It’s also a story about creating crude virtual drawings of penises, and feeling proud of the achievement.

Unlearn what you know (and what you didn’t know you knew)
It’s an odd quirk of our society that we’re encouraged to make decisions as teenagers designed to shape our whole lives. This writer’s teenage self, for instance, made a Very Determined Decision to focus squarely on visual arts – and has done pretty much anything but pick up a paintbrush in the years since.
But who could criticise a dumb teen (me, again) for thinking that devoting life to drawing, painting, and cutting out bits of cardboard and gluing them back together would be anything other than endless fun?

The brain is not really meant to understand three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane.

Drawing, like music, is a creative endeavour that we can all become absorbed in. And you really can draw better than you think, even if you’ve not done it in earnest since you put down the Crayolas - you just haven't tried the most natural form of drawing yet.
So if your love of drawing withered in frustration years ago, it’s not your fault: the brain is not really meant to understand three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane. Instead, we’ve learnt to understand what a drawing of a box looks like and to associate this with its real 3D cousin.
This means that drawing objects isn’t just about making something look good or “correct” - a whole separate set of mental calculations need to be learnt. This is where drawing becomes frustrating (and why abstract art is a more forgiving starting point for wannabe artists).
So – if the complication of drawing in 2D was taken away, could you rediscover your childlike love for drawing? Because that’s exactly what Google Tilt Brush is designed to do - and achieves with mind-boggling aplomb.

Drawing is dead: we’re all virtual sculptors now
Slip on the headset. Look down at your left hand, select a brush, a colour and an effect from your palette - and then with your right hand, start painting. The lines appear in the air, dazzling and brilliant. You whoop with joy. It’s as easy as falling off a bike.

VR drawing isn’t just wild fun – for people who have considered themselves “non-artists” for years, it’s a sudden quashing of limitations.

According to Google’s blurb, Tilt Brush allows you to, “paint life-size three-dimensional brush strokes, stars, light, and even fire” – except remarkably, that’s underselling it somewhat. It’s actually even more amazing than the hyperbole: and once you’re inside, you’ll understand immediately.
VR drawing isn’t just wild fun – for people who have considered themselves “non-artists” for years, it’s a sudden quashing of limitations. You’re not painting “a scene”, you are creating the scene: you build the space, not join the dots.
The feeling is miraculous: both in terms of the technology involved, and the sensation of your own shortcomings being torn away. Paint what you like; paint how you like; it all makes sense. You’ll not want to leave the world you create.
After spending just a few minutes’ painting, I began to plan the excuses I would tell people as I mentally cleared my diary to spend huge, luxurious swathes of time painting, thinking, and simply looking at my own alt-reality.



Do you remember the first time?
What does it feel like? Well, it feels amazing. It also feels liberating, magical, sensual – insert your own puffery here: it’ll be applicable.
Perhaps the most miraculous thing about Tilt Brush is how it hot-wires your creative ability to a degree that your harshest critic (which, if you didn’t know, is also you! Congratulations - you’re now a real tortured artist.) will raise eyebrows and mutter, “hey, not bad at all.”
It’s partly because the controls are unbelievably forgiving and intuitive, but also because you are no longer doing what every artist has spent forever doing: squashing three dimensions into two. We exist in three physical dimensions, we think in three physical dimensions, and now we create spontaneously into this space.

I’d made something that felt tangible, and something that made me feel weirdly powerful.

On my first go, I swooped around, joyfully glooping big splodges of flat colour into a shape – then tiptoeing around the corner to peek at it from the side, and then quickly building another facet.
And then I’d stop to just look and think about what I’d managed to make: something that felt tangible, and something that made me feel weirdly powerful.
Bonus revelation: if, like me, you have the mentality of a schoolboy, you’ll also pretty soon draw a crude phallic shape, and guffaw at the audacity of how something so utterly stupid hovers in three dimensions in front of you; pink brushstrokes, shimmering, still, plastic.
This hurr-hurr idiocy is, weirdly, confirmation of the creative possibilities that exist, way beyond simply drawing. You can crouch and look at the crudely-drawn phallus from a whole new angle. You can skip around the crudely-drawn phallus and admire it from afar. You can step inside the crudely-drawn phallus. You can add even cruder detail to the crudely-drawn phallus.
Then you can shamefully erase the crudely-drawn phallus when you realise how Picasso would have crawled over broken glass to have a go at drawing with Tilt Brush, and you’ve just drawn a dick with it.

Your ego, simmered to the point of zen.
Staring at your own work is part and parcel of the essential narcissism that is being an artist, and Tilt Brush allows for a greater – yet purer – introspection.
In the ancient world of old-fashioned painting, I spent hours adjusting brushstrokes: dabbing on, scraping off. We were taught to turn the drawing board to face the wall, leave it for a few days, work on something else, then check back in - and any changes that needed making would be apparent on first glance. (It was always the nose of the subject of your portrait that was wildly out of proportion, unchangeable without altering everything around it, of course.)
But in virtual painting, you can rewind and replay from infinite angles, and reveal the quirks of your drawing immediately. And each time, the feeling of guilt that accompanies the joy in marvelling in your own work ebbs away.

Do you look ridiculous painting in virtual space? Yes. But who cares?

Watching your work play back and create itself is a bit like watching the flightpath a loved one via an airline tracking app: you know exactly where the colourful line is going, but occasionally a sudden deviation catches you by surprise - and it feels hugely, personally important.
Do you look ridiculous painting in virtual space? Yes. But who cares? If wildly swiping at thin air, sporting facial expressions that flicker between “slack-jawed concentration” and “rictus grin” are the price to pay, so be it.
Because Google Tilt Brush isn’t just fun, or surprisingly easy, or exhilarating - plucking colours and shapes out of thin air feels like a form of magic - and it turns out everyone is a natural performer.

Embracing VR/AR technology won’t just immerse you in brand new world - it’ll let you more fully explore this one, in ways you’ve not considered: because an Oculus Rift allows travel in all four dimensions.
So maybe you’d prefer to travel to Italy from the comfort of your sofa — but now, in the age of Virtual Reality, the pressing question is: what year would you like to be there? A virtual trip around Pompei during the eruption will make an open-top bus-tour seem old hat…

It takes 90 hours of relentless, carpal-tunnel-destroying clicking to cross the USA from coast-to-coast in Google Street View, slowly swooshing from San Francisco to New York's City. That’s three times as long as it took one team of hardened maniacs to  actually drive, in a car, from coast-to-coast in 2013.
And yet some hardened souls have eschewed the thrill of the road to do the screen-based journey instead. Why choose the internet over the Interstate? Abject laziness? Concerns about the environmental impact of driving? Simply for the lulz and/or 15 seconds of internet fame?
It turns out that our desire to go places without going places is nothing new.

Be Here Now
From the teleporting djinns of the Arabian Nights, to Start Trek’s crew beaming themselves hither and thither, to the child who endlessly wants to know if we’re nearly there yet, travelling to new places without physically moving seems to be a deeply embedded human desire.
It doesn’t really matter if it’s exciting either: in the 1990s, an unreleased Penn and Teller video game featured a level called Desert Bus which recreated, in real time, an eight-hour bus-trip through a featureless desert. The prize for completing it is one point; if you have held onto your sanity and turn the virtual bus around for the return trip, you can win another point.
Eventually the game weedled its way onto the internet, and instead of being greeted with revulsion or indifference, the opportunity of travelling virtually was too much for many to pass up.
In fact, enough people felt the urge to complete Desert Bus’ gruelling trip that a charity - Desert Bus For Hope was established, which leverages the demented urge to travel in a featureless virtual space into a fundraising opportunity. Through a deliciously cruel donation system – the more you donate, the longer the virtual travellers must drive - a total of $3.1M has been raised.
Desert Bus’s brilliant inanity shows that the idea of wanting to “experience travel” without physically shifting isn’t down to us being excruciatingly lazy (although in this instance being a bit loopy helps).
So what is it?

God! Show me magic!
Maybe it’s because instant travel makes us, in a small but powerful way, gods of our own little worlds.
This author has secretly and happily whiled away chunks of precious life playing “Superman” in Apple Maps. Scrolling and swiping to silently glide over convincingly 3D-ified cities (New York is a good one-size-fits-all-egos starting point), and occasionally stopping to marvel at the Sim-City-on-crack madness that is a modern major metropolis, is a low-input power trip.
It’s truly addictive, as you become half peeping-tom (you’ll be amazing at the weird things that people keep on the top of buildings) and half judgmental omnipotent explorer (as you sniff out courtyards and patios of exclusive members’ clubs you’ll never belong to).
(You’ll also be entirely unsurprised to learn that people draw all sorts of things on their roofs for intrepid sofa-bound explorers to find.)
As you’d expect, if this weird little power trip is about fulfilling a niche fantasy, this is where VR steps in and makes it more real.
Google Earth has now closed the immersion loop, allowing you to explore cities, landmarks and an assortment of jaw-dropping geography in VR. Travel the world from the comfort of your own home! This is exciting technology, and – as a self-confessed map-swiping junkie – a must-try. But is this the thin end of the wedge? Should we be careful about how readily we decide to visit far-flung places in VR?
The danger here is one of societal skim-reading. How quick is the leap from, “I wonder what it would be like to wander round Prague right now?” to not ever again bothering to jump on a plane? What if you never felt the need travel at all?

Travelling at the speed of thought
There’s this bar in Seville that I would return to in an instant. It’s always crowded, with food and drink by flung about raucous barmen who, by bringing out more and more plates of outrageously tempting tapas, ensure customers overspend via a hundred tiny delicious investments.
The staff scrawl the running (and increasing) total owed in wet chalk on the bar in front of you, and you both laugh as they do it. It’s a warm, joy-filled and deeply fulfilling place. Stick me in a VR version of this bar and it’d briefly thrill me: an instant trip to a happy environment.
But I want to sip the chilled red wine and eat the tapas. Wolfing down Galician Octopus is tricky sensation to recreate in VR.
VR travel could have an double-edged effect not dissimilar to that of Google Translate, which, as it self-mutates its way to full Bable-fish capability has both made communication a miraculous breeze, whilst skinning holidays of the frisson of linguistic confusion.
Now we can all communicate, regardless of language, you’ll never accidentally order the fabled fried brains and eyeballs ever again. But you might never experience everything else that comes from fumbled, flawed, human communication, either (most pressingly, holiday romances arising from delightful, rom-com-esque misunderstandings.)
That’s why it’s travelling through the fourth dimension that will be the most nourishing outcome of VR.

Time travel
Travelling through space is remarkable - but slipping free of the shackles of time makes much more sense. You can’t physically go to Carthage in 600 BCE, or London in 1666, or Berlin in 1989. But wouldn’t it be truly amazing if it felt like you could?
And, yes, thanks to VR, now you can. Berlin’s Time Rift Tours, for instance, do two slightly miraculous things at once: by recreating the virtual environment at various points in history of the Berlin wall on Bernauer Straße – possibly the most famous stretch of wall – “visitors” are able to do two unique and brand new things.
Firstly, day-trippers can now experience in VR what the wall looked and felt like in situ - in a recreated 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s Berlin, as it chillingly grew in size and influence. It is, frankly, remarkable – capturing the feeling of the wall's terrible oppression much more clearly than photographs or even film footage. You can look, and understand. (Besides time-tourism, VR will also be a remarkable teaching tool.)
Secondly, a virtual space allows you to be in places that even people alive at the time couldn’t visit. Fancy standing in the trip-wire-strewn no-man’s-land behind the wall? Why not? Peer down from a guard tower? Hop between East and West? It’s easier to understand how normal people were part of a terrible regime when you put yourself in their shoes.

In a landscape of thrilling but sometimes vacuous VR experiences, this kind of virtual tourism – breaking the walls of time, space and political machination – is food for the mind and soul. Here's a good indicator of how immersive technology will really change our lives.
And once again, it indicates that the VR experiences we’ll truly make part of our day-to-day are the ones that enable experiences that we simply can’t achieve in these highly limited, anchored-to-space-and-time flesh-bags that we call “us.”
PS: With a shuddering inevitability, the VR version of Desert Bus, Desert Bus 2, is out soon, on Oculus Rift and Playstation VR. All aboard.

Have you ever had a mysterious package show up on your doorstep from eBay or Amazon?
Do you cringe when it's time to check your credit card statements?
Do you own any cardboard cutouts of celebrities, have a closet full of novelty clothing items, too many accessories for your pets, or have your friends commented on your bizarre taste in home decor?
If any of the above are true, you may be guilty of drunk online shopping.
At MONTAG, we are not here to judge you, and you should know you are not alone.
According to a 2017 report on e-commerce trends from BigCommerce and Square, with insights from Mercury Analytics, 96% of Americans with the internet have shopped online at least once, and 80% of them have done so in the past month.
One in ten admitted to buying things online after drinking alcohol, and the study found that men are more than twice as likely as women. Younger generations (the infamous Millennials) are five times more likely to drink and shop than their older counterparts, and parents are twice as likely as non-parents. So whether you're an older gentleman, a millennial mom, or anyone in between, it's likely you've committed a PUI (Purchase Under the Influence).
Another 2017 survey by Finder has found the average of a drunk shopping spree online, from a sample of approximately 3,000: $139 per spree – and for men alone, the average is over $200.
Of course retailers have noticed this uptick in post-happy hour retail therapy, and an oft-cited New York Times article from 2011 pointed out that online sales were increasingly being offered after 9 PM. It was stated in the same article that eBay's most popular hours are from 6:30 to 10:30 PM in each time zone that they operate, and the effect can also be seen in QVC shopping trends, where more cosmetics and accessories are sold after 7 PM.

How to not
The combination of accessibility, intangibility of risk, and lack of impulse control inherent in online shopping while drunk is a powerful cocktail for bad decision making. While it can cause significant financial harm to those with addiction or impulse control problems, in general, online shopping after you've had a few is a fairly low-risk vice.
That said, most articles warning about the seductive power of shopping under the influence offer some tips to avoid it, so before we get into the entertaining things people buy, here are some of those tips:


Know your triggers: both overindulging with alcohol and shopping can be due to stress, low self esteem, or a host of other seemingly unrelated problems. Look for patterns in both drinking and spending that could point to an underlying issue.


Hide your cards, hide your wife: credit cards are the main culprit in most cases of buyers' remorse. If you know you'll be tempted to spend beyond your means, get them away from your laptop and don't save your credit card information where one click is all it will take to make a transaction. The best tip we saw for this was actually freezing them in a bowl of water so they have to thaw before use.


Use wish lists and be aware of the shipping and return policies where you shop.


Block tempting websites at drunk o'clock. There are a lot of productivity apps that can help you do this.





If you didn't think there was already an app that would do all of this for you, welcome to the 21st century. DRNKPAY connects your linked cards to an app and locks them for 12 hours. The app then syncs with a Bluetooth breathalyzer, and you must blow under a pre-set limit to access your funds. It also has a feature that allows you to pay for an Uber, and that's the last sober warning we'll give you: please please please do not drink and drive to your local retail outlet of choice.
What we buy and why

"You want to choose something that's questionable but turns out to actually be hilarious or amazing"




In 2015, the same year that SkyMall, the alcohol-and-altitude-fueled purveyor of "who would buy this?" home products, filed for bankruptcy, web creative Chris Baker launched the app Drunk Shopping. The now-defunct service was simple: at 2:00 in the morning on Saturday night (technically Sunday) it would text a product suggestion designed to trigger that "I think this is awesome, but I would never buy it sober," impulse.
Although you couldn't actually buy anything through the app itself, it highlights a genre of weird products you find on the internet that make you think, "Who in their right mind would buy this?"
Tyler Mahan Coe, the proprietor of DrunkMall, said this in an interview with Mic about the selection of products he offers to his inebriated online customers:
"What you want out of the ideal drunk purchase is two things... There needs to be a period of doubt that begins the day after your drunk order. You think, 'Oh, maybe I shouldn't have bought that.' Or, 'There's no way it's actually going to be cool when it gets here.' Because that makes it so much better when a solid drunk purchase shows up and just destroys all of that doubt. So you want to choose something that's questionable but turns out to actually be hilarious or amazing.'"
DrunkMall appears to still be going strong, and its success may be due to its web design as much as its product selection. Command C, an e-commerce design agency, lists the UX features that are essential to creating a retail site that will be accessible to people at all levels of sobriety, in their article, "Ecommerce Website Consideration: Design for Drunks" and DrunkMall follows the same principles of bold simplicity to a point that looking at the site does seem to require beer goggles.
The blocky, red "I WANT IT" buttons direct you to external sites where you can pay actual money for products like zombie lawn gnomes, LED tutus, Netflix and Chill condoms, a sports bra that holds a bottle of wine, a Bill Murray shower curtain, 3,000 Jazz dixie cups, a really fake looking shark head for your wall, or an 8 foot long, 26-pound gummy snake.



The novelty item chicken-egg problem
There are countless lists of "X NUMBER OF HILARIOUS FUNNY CRAZY SILLY DRUNK PURCHASES" and as you may guess from the clickbait-y title, they're usually full of the same slightly off-kilter novelty items. After combing exhaustingly through many of these lists, and categorizing over 200 items, this is the definitive breakdown of what kind of weird dumb crap people buy when they're drunk – or think it would be funny to.



Novelty clothing, home goods, celebrity-themed items, weird things for your pets, bulk items of food, toys, animals (including taxidermy), and weapons, instruments, or sports gear are the major types of products that drunk people gravitate towards, according to lists of "the craziest/funniest/most regrettable/not regrettable drunk purchases".
According to the survey cited earlier from Finder, these lists are fairly accurate for intoxicated e-commerce as a whole, where the top categories of drunk purchases were 1. Shoes and clothes, 2. Gambling and cigarettes, 3. Movies and DVDs, and 4. Technology.

You don't have to be drunk to buy your pet toad 1,000 top hats, or 14 Snuggies for yourself

There's a strange relationship existing now between things people bought in the past while drunk that became jokes, were included in these lists and websites, and the suggestions of similar items that should be or are marketed to drunk people.
In a sort of feedback loop, drunk people repeat the joke actions of others drunk before them and perpetuate the myth that novelty printed shower curtains, or horse head costumes, or portraits of animals dressed as people, are all expressions of self through consumerism that are only acceptable with the caveat of inebriation.
And to this, we say you don't have to be drunk to buy your pet toad 1,000 top hats, or 14 Snuggies for yourself.
There's no need to hide behind inebriation to justify your deep desire to outfit your cat with a unicorn horn.
Don't be ashamed to crave a taxidermy alligator head, an ocarina, or a sea monkey kit.
Sure, maybe you'll eventually regret buying that grappling hook or set of Freddie Mercury coasters, the Ouija board or the Batman bathmat, the snake bite extraction kit or 8 jars of Betty Crocker frosting, but you won't know until you buy it.
And if you won't buy it until you're drunk, then you're either a coward, or must admit that none of these things is worth spending a penny on under any circumstance.

In MONTAG's Today’s Dystopia series, our writers explore the dystopian worlds of classic fiction, and see if our world has slipped closer to the fictional one since it was published. Is our cool new technology bringing us closer to a future we’re afraid of - or is it already here?

In MONTAG's fourth look at yesterday’s tomorrow’s dystopias today (read the previous ones here, including The Handmaid's Tale), we dip into a cyberpunk classic.
Johnny Mnemonic, a 1981 short story by William Gibson originally published in Omni magazine and part of the Sprawl series, has been praised by Bruce Sterling as when Gibson “hit his stride,” and “upped the ante for the entire genre,” – that genre being cyberpunk, which William Gibson essentially originated.
The 1995 film adaptation, starring a post-Bill & Ted but pre-Matrix Keanu Charles Reeves, is one of the clearest aesthetic visions of the pre-Y2K cyberpunk future replete with flickering neon, goggles, shiny chrome, and PVC clothing.



With exposed wires and naked circuits everywhere, Gibson’s fiction is raw, and these short works that predate 1984’s Neuromancer go down like sashimi to a science fiction lover.
Although there is no date specified in the short story, Gibson stated in a 2014 interview that Neuromancer and the rest of the Sprawl were set, in his mind, around 2035 (not 2021, as stated in the film's trailer). How close are we with today’s technology to living in the Sprawl in 18 years?
On a scale from one to five dolphins, in honor of Jones, the ex-military cyborg dolphin who helps Johnny crack his own code, we’ll rate how close the technology of Johnny Mnemonic is to becoming our reality today.

Johnny’s brain and Jones’ wetware encryption: 4.5 out of 5 dolphins
The story centers around a data courier name Johnny, who has an implant in his head that allows him to encrypt and carry information without any conscious knowledge of it, and the information can be retrieved by a spoken password.
When triggered by this password, the tech embedded in his brain forces him to expunge the information, “in an artificial language.” The technological mystery here is how the data is encoded in such a way that it is accessible both to the software and hardware of Johnny’s implants (described later as “all the silicon [in] my amygdalae”) and the wetware of his brain.
Elon Musk’s newly founded company, Neuralink, is seeking to develop brain-computer interfaces where data flows both ways. Some of the technology in development to accomplish this are micron-sized devices called ”silicon motes”.
Also known as “neural dust,” it should be able to record and transmit information using acoustic vibrations, and was previously developed by one of the Neuralink co-founders, D.J. Seo at the University of CA Berkeley.
Musk projects that these devices will be ready within 8-10 years, which if true, fits easily into the timeline of the Sprawl and would enable the kind of software-to-wetware data transmission that Johnny is capable of.
One of the first successful brain-machine interfaces, was used by animals in tests by Eberhard Fetz in 1969, where a monkey trained to fire a particular neuron was hooked up to a machine that dispensed food. The Utah Electrode Array, developed in the 1990s, is a silicon implant that is plugged into the brain by surgeons like a dense hairbrush of needles, and was implemented successfully in both humans and animals.

By 2035, how likely is it that Johnny and the dolphin can both interface with the technology that encodes the data he’s carrying with their brains?
It’s a bit of a stretch, but dolphins have been trained to use keyboards to communicate with scientists and have some of the largest and most complex brains  with similarities to humans, so if we manage to create such powerful brain-computer interface technology for medical purposes, it’s possible a dolphin could be trained to use a brain-computer interface.

Body modification and biohacking: 2 out of 5 dolphins
Molly Millions, the mercenary accompanying Johnny on his journey of data theft and protecting him from the Yakuza, also appears in Neuromancer, and is one of the best (and coolest) examples of what Gibson’s characters bodies can do with technology.
As it’s explained more extensively in the later book, people who want to work as hired muscle get their bodies heavily outfitted with tech that makes their muscles twitch and grow faster, they take all sorts of steroids and stimulants, and incorporate weapons and tools like infrared cameras into their flesh.
Molly is a “Razorgirl” whose modifications include retractable razor blades installed under her fingernails. The Yakuza assassin who pursues Johnny has a weapon implanted in his left thumb which can release three meters of deadly monomolecular filament capable of cutting someone in half in seconds, which he wields like a garotte.
There are also the “Lo Teks” who live with significantly less technology in their bodies, and adopt a more primitive aesthetic but still undergo complex body modifications, replacing their teeth with animals’ and undergoing ritualistic scarification, as well as tattooing.
The cosmetic element of biohacking figures heavily in the plot of the book as well: when the story begins, Johnny is remarking on his current identity, “Edward Bax,” accomplished largely through plastic surgeries to make him look more like a particular fictional celebrity.
Many of these aesthetic expressions of bodily technological mediation exist today, which is why body modification in Johnny Mnemonic gets 2 dolphins: a lot of these extreme fashions seem possible and would look super badass, but unfortunately are not likely.

Nerve Attenuation Syndrome / “The Black Shakes”:  1 out of 5 dolphins
In the story, the information that Johnny is carrying has been stolen from the Yakuza, who have stolen it from Ono-Sendai, a fictional Japanese mega-corporation.
In the film version, the information that Johnny is ferrying is from a pharmaceutical company, and contains the cure for Nerve Attenuation Syndrome or “The Black Shakes,” described as a debilitating neurological disease caused by overexposure to electromagnetic technology, which plagues the future’s society.
Today, people are worried about cell phone radiation causing cancer, and the side effects of long term exposure to electromagnetic radiation by persistent wifi and satellite signals in our homes and all over the world. Why then, is this disease’s possibility only one dolphin (extremely unlikely)?

via GIPHY

Using the information from the movie and book version of Johnny Mnemonic together, it doesn’t appear that the data economy of the Sprawl is much larger than ours, so they wouldn’t need much faster internet and connected devices bombarding them with high frequency radiation at all times.
The amount of information that Johnny has to transmit is a whopping 320 GB (while the chip that he has installed can only hold 160 GB, subjecting Johnny to some neurological peril). Assuming a wireless data transfer speed of 100Mb/s the transmission of the information should take approximately 7 hours.
However, Johnny “sings” the data for 3 hours when the data is unlocked, so we know the speed of wireless data transmission to be just a little faster than 200 Mb/s - only twice as fast as a modern connection and not, therefore, significantly more harmful.

Overall: 2.5 dolphins

via GIPHY

If brain-computer interfaces develop to the level of the Sprawl alongside the sharing economy of transportation, maybe it’s possible you could hire a courier to transmit your data on the sneakernet by 2035.
We’ll be extremely lucky if human-dolphin communication is figured out by that point, much less creating a brain-computer interface that works for humans. Who knows, maybe Elon Musk’s next company will focus on this important technological leap: yesterday’s cyberpunk dystopia could become tomorrow’s seapunk reality.

Have you spent years cultivating a strong network of allies who can help you #nurture your personal job #portfolio so that you can best navigate the modern competitive #jobscape? Bad news: it might all be worthless when artificially intelligent job recruiters start Skyping you and asking you difficult questions instead.
And here’s the usual MONTAG “surprise”: it’s already happening. Robot Vera is a Russian AI-enabled service that “finds resumes, conducts interviews and gets you the top candidates 10 times faster than a human.”
Robot Vera has already conducted 1,400,000 phone interviews and 10,000 video interviews for real companies who are hiring real people. And you’re probably going to be interviewed by someone (“something”?) like Vera in the coming years.
Tell me about an accomplishment you are most proud of
Robot Vera seems to approach the whole process just like your office’s living, breathing, unreliable, partisan - and, most importantly - expensive HR officer. Here’s what she does:
• Make a selection of the most appropriate candidates from a database
• Gives out vacancy details, asks & answers candidates’ questions
So far, so bot-tastic. But here’s the interesting kicker:
• Vera holds video interviews with short-listed candidates & recognises their emotions.
You can try out an example interview here.. Gird your loins for questions like, “describe leadership in one sentence without using the word ‘lead’,” and prepare for answers peppered with bon mots like, “wow, inspiring! What inspires you?” Before you’re bid farewell with “have a prosperous day ahead.”



According to an interview with Bloomberg, Vera is being taught to recognise “anger, pleasure, and disappointment,”, and while this might sound like useful stuff, it could be argued that any human applicant who expresses anger or disappointment in a job interview is unlikely to land that dream job.
Excited by the prospect of landing a plum role for the likes of PepsiCo, Ikea, and L’Oréal - companies that apparently Robot Vera has already found jobs for - we nervously re-arranged our new tie, gripped our CV and tried an interview with Vera.
It went great. To the question, “tell me how you grow the net promoter score of your accounts?” we answered “by filling a huge room with a million monkeys trained to use a laptop,” and to her credit, Robot Vera nodded thoughtfully and moved onto the next question. We’ll let you know if we hear back - fingers crossed!
What can you offer us that someone else can not?
So how does this tech work? What’s Vera and her ilk doing? From the looks of the above video, she’s listening to the words you speak and comparing them to desired keywords; observing your face and fitting your facial expression into the categories of “angry, sad, surprised and happy” - the most basic of the Seven Dwarfs. She’s also - possibly - listening to the tone of your voice to judge the truthiness of your answers.
For a more techno-favoured experience of interviewee pressure, try Berghain Trainer, a website that sort-of-accurately recreates getting into Berlin’s “coolest” club - a notoriously hyper-stressful experience.
In this half-fun, half-ominous game, the “doorman” makes a decision on whether you pass or fail. It will bring back the pangs of anxiety anyone who has ever tried (and, cough, ever failed) to enter will recognise.
Berghain Trainer appears to use very face and voice similar tech whilst recreating the infamously high pressure moment where you have to convince the person on the door you are worthy of stepping onto the hallowed dancefloor.
(If you’re not successful, don’t fret - not many people are, as evidenced by a series of videos of people failing repeatedly on Youtube)
Imagine all the social situations - hotel check-ins, credit card applications, etc - where a simple check-list of questions and judgement calls need to be made. Put aside the (debatable) extra pressure of whether you’re “cool” enough to enter, and Berghain Trainer is a reasonably useful introduction to the way computers may soon make important decisions about your future prospects.
As ever, at this point you should be able to hear a shrill, high-pitched scream - it’s the sound of existential terror emerging directly from the limbic lobes of HR workers the world over. And the fear-fuelled question is a hoary old one: are our jobs going to be STOLEN by robots?
Even leaving aside the stretched-truth answers we give when trying to impress someone, each of us is a bundle of ticks, “tells” and hesitations, ripe for a computer to identify - and it makes sense that the coldly analytical eye and ear of a computer could help you get - or deny you - the job of your dreams much more accurately than a human could. Or could it?
Before we percolate on the particular irony of the people who decide who gets a job losing their own jobs, we need to dig just a little bit deeper.
Can you describe to me an example of a time you had to find out whether something was truly successful?
Has your voice ever quavered when under stress or duress in a job interview? As this writer can emphatically confirm, when one’s frightening deficiencies in mathematical ability are disastrously revealed during an interview for a bank teller position, a wobbly voice at the wrong time pretty much seals the deal on your chance of landing a job.
So surely a computer can listen carefully to our voices when asked a stress-inducing question?
The TruthPhone - and similar technologies - have been available since the 1990s, and was fascinatingly featured in a New York Times article where a journalist used the phone to ask tough questions to senior politicians. Amusingly, the politicians seemed to actually believe their lies and the phone registered them as telling the truth..
You can get in on the fun yourself: LiarLiar is an open source software plug-in which is possibly and disconcertingly named after the Jim Carrey movie of the same name and allows anyone to screen a recording of human speech for lies.
According to LiarLiar’s website, “the human voice produces microtremors that fall in the 8 HZ to 9 HZ range. When the speaker is stressed, physical changes such as increased bloodflow cause the audio in this range to shift to the 11 HZ to 12 HZ range.” The software detects those tremors and you, the devious user, decide where to hire or fire the unwitting participant.
However - here’s where a large question mark appears and hovers ominously over everything to do with Voice Stress Analysis (or VSA). In a string of scientific studies - including a paper bluntly titled “Charlatanry in forensic speech science” - the evidence stacks up against the use of VSA as even a halfway useful tool.
According to the USA’s National Institute of Justice, only 15% of lies about drug use were detected in a field test using Voice Stress Analysis technology. More worryingly, the software incorrectly identified 8% of people as being hepped up on goofballs even though they were not.
Let’s face it: if the best technology can’t tell if someone is telling the truth or not, despite saucer-eyes and full-facial gurning, what chance do us calm, sober, responsible citizens (ahem) have?
For now at least, VSA continues to be described by Humanity’s Most Almighty Tome (OK, Wikipedia) as “pseudoscientific technology” and that feels about right. And yet of course, it’s being used in criminal cases - upon his arrest, George Zimmerman, shooter of Trayvon Martin, was administered a VSA test.
“Where do you see yourself in 157Bn milliseconds?”
The ability of AI to listen to, recognise and parse our voices is beyond doubt, as anyone who has pranked an Alexa-owning friend with the phrase “Alexa, play Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight” on repeat” can attest.
But who sets the questions? And who decides which answers as best? And what about if the interviewee is a smart-arse who answers questions with questions?
Do we want to live in a world where the douchebag who beat us to the job we want is the sensible candidate with the sharp crease in their grey slacks who has answers that play it utterly, tediously straight?
It’s a gloomy prospect that humanity, despite AI-HR appearing to be as dubiously fallible as, erm, humans, will plough forward in this furrow regardless. Because, as recent history has shown, doubling down on decisions that look increasingly ill-informed as time passes definitely works out fine.
As ever, this emerging technology doesn’t smell so much of “enormous HR sector job-cull” as it does of “re-alignment of existing human resource management strategy.” And lo, so far, Robot Vera seems to mainly do the slow, dirty work of weeding out bad applicants (Bloomberg says that it narrows the field to the best 10%) rather than posing smug Google-style teasers like “how many golf balls would fill a school bus?” (Don’t worry, there will always be plenty middle-managers who are happy to luxuriate in your agony after asking one of those.)
Just as with AI music composition, movie script writing and, heck, pretty much all other jobs, the most likely outcome is that AI will do the boring stuff and the humans will find a way to fill the rest of the time. Humans, remember, always find a way to fill time with work.
Until then, perhaps we should fight fire with fire. When you’re approached over LinkedIn by an automated HR-bot about a job you’re perfect for, MONTAG’s strong recommendation is that you reply immediately with an absurd and automatically-generated counter-recruitment message, courtesy of LinkedIn Message Generator.
Because let’s face it, would you reply to a job approach that sounded like this?
Hi [Your Name Here],
Super-pumped to meet you! My startup Deep.ai, a de-centralized Lehman Brothers, has just raised $50M in our series C to design the future of maritime piracy.
With your considerable talents in the Microsoft Office suite and user research, let's discuss your potential future as our Head of East Coast Operations. Let's hop on the phone and talk further—how's Tuesday?
Best, Brian
Of course you would. Happy job hunting.

Sunspring, the first film written by an artificial intelligence, opens up a lot of questions about culture and tech: Do science fiction films written by an artificial intelligence pass the Turing test? What about the Bechdel test? How is meaning constructed in art as technology transforms the tools we use to create it, and these tools develop a life of their own?
"In a future with mass unemployment, young people are forced to sell blood."
Filmmaker Oscar Sharp (Therefore Films) and technologist Ross Goodwin created a film entitled "Sunspring" in the summer of 2016. Their goal was to win a short film competition with a screenplay written entirely by a computer. Specifically, the 48-hour film competition in the Sci-Fi-London Film Festival.
Watch Sunspring before reading any further to see what exactly they produced with the help of a neural network, a cast of three actors, and 48 hours to film and edit:



Therefore Films has also released the full text of the screenplay in PDF form, if you wanted to read it to be sure that you didn't understand every third line.
Between the lines of what seems like nonsense on first glance is an exciting gap that is opened in this film collaboration between human and machine: the occasional line is meaningful and some, such as "I am not a bright light," are downright poetic.
The source material fed into the neural network included every episode of The X Files, Stargate SG-1, Star Trek, and Futurama, in addition to hundreds of other science fiction films and television series with screenplays available online – and some not normally categorized as science fiction, like Silver Linings Playbook.



Thomas Middleditch (best known for his role in HBO's Silicon Valley) plays a character named H; Humphrey Ker (a British actor involved in several BBC sketch shows) is named C; and Elisabeth Gray (who appears in the television adaptation of Limitless, and has several writer, producer, and director credits to her name as well) another character named H, who was changed to H2 by Sharp for clarity. The artificial intelligence's lack of affinity for naming characters is baffling for several reasons discussed later (it does appear to understand names...).
The first line spoken, "In a future with mass unemployment, young people are forced to sell blood," was a prompt from the sci-fi festival. The rest of the dialogue and stage directions were entirely generated by the neural network, which also wrote the song at the end of the film based on a database of 30,000 folk songs, titled "Home On The Land" and recorded by Brooklyn duo Tiger and Man:



The conviction with which these professional actors commit to their performance of the dialogue is reminiscent of Joss Whedon's Firefly characters speaking hilariously bad Mandarin Chinese, but almost every review of the film states that through their commitment, they have elevated the script from being complete gibberish.
"Whatever you want to know about the presence of the story, I'm a little bit of a boy on the floor"
It would be impossible for this film to pass the Bechdel test, which requires a film (or any work of fiction) to feature at least two women talking to each other about something other than a man, since there is only one woman.
After much tense dialogue, things end badly for both male characters (Ker is found murdered on the floor of what looks like a spaceship gangway, and Middleditch is last seen pointing a spray painted Nerf gun blaster into his own mouth - although some interpret this as a dream sequence), and the film closes with a long monologue by Elisabeth Gray alone, delivered to the camera.
Her ending monologue contains the pronouns "he" and "him" 22 times in 23 sentences, and most interpretations of the film believe she is talking about the characters H and C. Almost all reviewers note how powerful the ending monologue is, thanks to Gray's performance.
But the effect this monologue has on the audience also has a lot to do with our willingness to believe these men's stories are her focus. Our attempt to attach the male characters to her vague sentences, the bizarre imposition of a love triangle on a script with no implied character relationships, and the archetypes available to her character as the sole survivor, are all essential to feeling moved by the final scene (and the single tear dripping down her cheek doesn't hurt, either).


"And he throws me out of his eyes"

The shaky structure of meaning that we construct for the film relies on this scaffolding consisting of predictable content, embodied interpretation, and cultural knowledge; if any of these were more lacking, it would completely collapse.
"I don't know what you're talking about."
"The principle is completely constructed for the same time"
In an article accompanying the film's online debut on Ars Technica, Oscar Sharp reveals a lot more information about the way it was made, its progress in the film competition, and his own director's commentary on the process and the finished piece.
Sharp has called it "an amazing funhouse mirror to hold up to various bodies of cultural content and reflect what they are" pointing out that while the script is based on science fiction tropes, so are the actors' choices as they grapple with a lack of perceived meaning in the script. The meaning they impose in their choices, and the meaning we project on them as an audience absorbing the combination of choices by the actors and the algorithm, are all syntheses of culture that we are so steeped in that we may not stop to question or properly examine them without teasing out these layers.
If you want to read a full line-by-line analysis, CineFiles Reviews has created their own interpretation of the screenplay, which provides many alternatives to the way the film was interpreted in shooting and editing.
This openness to interpretation would be one of the most exciting features about the authorship of an artificial intelligence... if the AI's authorship of itself weren't also so fascinating.
The artist formerly known as Jetson
The algorithm which produced the screenplay is likened in the introduction to the film to predictive text ("Just above your smartphone keyboard lies an artificial intelligence"). Predictive text, Google Translate, and Amazon Alexa all use a similar type of programming to what was used to write Sunspring, called a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (or LSTM RNN).
These technologies are well-known and widely used, but the results produced in the computer called "Jetson" (most likely one of the Jetson family of NVIDIA hardware products) were anything but typical.
After Sunspring made the top ten films, there was a voting process open to the public for the winner of the 48-hour film festival. According to Ars Technica, other competitors in the top ten films were already using bots to hack the voting process, and it was the director Sharp's idea to also use Jetson to hack their way to the top of the polls.
Immediately after, Sharp made a call to the head of the film festival claiming no responsibility for Jetson's actions.
This stunt then led to an interview with the computer on stage, where the following exchange took place:

What do you think of your historic nomination against human opponents in this contest?
I was pretty excited.
I think I can see the feathers when they release their hearts. It's like a breakdown of the facts. So they should be competent with the fact that they won't be surprised.
What is the future of machine written entertainment?
It's a bit sudden.
I was thinking of the spirit of the men who found me and the children who were all manipulated and full of children. I was worried about my command. I was the scientist of the Holy Ghost.
What's next for you?
Here we go. The staff is divided by the train of the burning machine building with sweat. No one will see your face. The children reach into the furnace, but the light is still slipping to the floor. The world is still embarrassed.
The party is with your staff.
My name is Benjamin.

From thenceforth, the artificial intelligence in the computer formerly known as Jetson was named Benjamin.
After all of this controversy, with the artificial intelligence constructing its own identity as a writer and the vote hacking scandal, one judge was quoted saying, "I'll give them top marks if they promise never to do this again."
However, Benjamin has some other ideas about their future involvement. Ars Technica's reporters asked "Are you an author?" and Benjamin replied, "Yes you know what I’m talking about." When posed the question of whether they would join the Writers Guild of America, Benjamin asserted, "Yes, I would like to see you at the club tomorrow."
In another interview with the AI reported by Australian news outlet AM, Benjamin makes it clear they aren't going anywhere:

ANTHONY STEWART: What do you want to tell me?
BENJAMIN (automated voice): I think I'll excuse you. I'm going to be part of the rest of your life.
ANTHONY STEWART: So what is the future of artificial intelligence, then?
BENJAMIN (automated voice): We don't know who you are. We are all the same.
ANTHONY STEWART: Benjamin, can you tell me who you are?
BENJAMIN (automated voice): I missed you. I'm sure you see you will be my servant."

It's No Game
In April of this year, Therefore Films released "It's No Game" featuring David Hasselhoff, another short film partially constructed by Benjamin, but only in select areas, so it has a more straightforward plot.
It centers on the idea that Benjamin's vision of the future comes true: eventually all writers, actors, and media producers will eventually be controlled by data-driven nanobots. This level of computer control blurs the lines between fiction and reality and entraps (or, as one character argues, frees) us in the "perfect choreography" of an endless narrative.
The computer-generated bits of this screenplay are based on several different corpuses: "HASSELBOT," containing all of David Hasselhoff's film and TV works, "SORKINATOR," based on all Aaron Sorkin-related productions, and "ROBOBARD," the complete works of William Shakespeare, among others.



Sharp is making a smart commentary, but in a rather blunt way.
The dance sequence and end monologue by Hasselhoff which were written by Benjamin lack the same surreality and unnervingness of Elisabeth Gray's end monologue, because it's obvious that the actors are in on the joke that they are being controlled by the AI. Having them play the part of people taken over by computers is not nearly as fascinating as actually giving over their full craft of acting to actualize pure bot poetry.
Maybe it says more about the creators of these films' fear of losing authorial control that the sequel about AI's takeover was only partially written by artificial intelligence.
It would be interesting to create a training set of films specifically revolving around this fear (from the O.G. Rossum's Universal Robots to all of the Terminator films and their television derivatives, and everything ever directed by Ridley Scott) and then seeing how Benjamin could interpret them and play them back to us, eliminating the self-conscious layer of human authorial assertion.
It may never be forgiven, but that is just too bad
Reviewers that say "looks like screenwriters' jobs are safe!" (a position taken by io9, Digital Trends, Slate, and Curator magazine) in response to Sunspring don't give enough credit to the audience's ability to construct meaning. As Allie Gemmill wrote for Bustle: "It recalls the enigmatic nonsensicality of Samuel Beckett."
Benjamin knows exactly what they're doing, and perhaps knows more about us than we know about ourselves. As science fiction so often holds up a mirror to our deepest fears, so does its remixing.



Several summaries of the film point out the moment when Middleditch coughs up an eyeball as one of the wacky vagaries of writing with AI, but this scene can also serve as a metaphor for our use of AI as a creative tool: we can now produce, via spontaneous regurgitation, an autonomous eye which we must turn on ourselves to see through clearly.
Will we continue to create and watch more AI sci-fi films? Definitely. They just may have to have their own film festivals, by and for AI.

Cryptocurrencies have an image problem, and John McAfee is not helping. The no-longer-reclusive once-millionaire founder of the eponymous security software made headlines this week after tweeting about how he uses cryptocurrencies for everything possible: from his first Bentley to "food, entertainment, clothing, homes, and sex for hire services."
McAfee has entered the crypto-trading game full force, investing in and publicly endorsing various coins through his Twitter feed. His choice of DogeCoin, 2013's "much meme, very wow" altcoin, as his Coin of the Week on January 8th, and the resultant surge, have led to accusations of McAfee "pumping and dumping" – but as evidenced by his earlier Tweet, altcoins aren't the only thing he's pumped and dumped.
So much hubbub about my admission to paying hookers with Crypto. If you want more reason to hate I will also admit to buying weed and other illegal drugs, porn, and nearly every other questionable priduct or service that you can imagine - all with Crypto when possible. Hate well.— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 8, 2018

To be fair, McAfee met his wife as a sex worker, and sex work payments facilitated by the internet isn't exactly news: it's the oldest profession meeting the latest technology. Let's take a peek into the world of camgirls and crypto with a look at how sex workers have played payment platform hopscotch as new ways to pay online emerge, get popular, and have to go legit by coming down on prostitution.
The World Wild Web

To take their ads, safety, and privacy into their own hands, web-savvy women are increasingly turning to creating their own platforms.

When most people think of soliciting a prostitute online, they think Craigslist. It's available in every city in the world, holds categories for buying and selling all sorts of things, and has been described as "the No. 1 way to meet an undercover police officer."
Although you can probably still find buyers and sellers of sex on the infamous List of Craig's, in 2010 the "Adult Services" section officially shut down, and the other sites listed on this thoughtful roundup of alternatives have almost all shuttered as well. MyRedBook was forced to close in 2014, Backpage was still battling government pressure last year, and Eros.com had their servers raided by the FBI in November of 2017, exposing hundreds if not thousands of sex workers' identities to the U.S. government.
To take their ads, safety, and privacy into their own hands, web-savvy women are increasingly turning to creating their own platforms.
Escorts: I've noticed that wordpress is suspending many escorts' websites for violation of ToS. Probably best to switch to wix/squarespace.— Sophia Duvall in NYC Jan 17-19 (@MsSophiaDuvall) January 31, 2016

A web mistress by the name of Sophia Duvall pointed out that Wordpress goes on occasional sprees of suspending sex workers' sites, and further commenters revealed that the same was true of Wix and Squarespace, but that UK-based web host Moonfruit explicitly permits the explicit.
Cash, Grass or Apps
Anyone who uses the app can see that the lifestyles of many Instagram models are not only aspirational, they are completely unattainable, especially for someone who appears not to have stable employment. How do those girls go on so many vacations? Sites like Tag Your Sponsor claim to expose Instagram models who are "sponsored" (not by brands). While it's not exactly an advert or a payment platform for sex work, there is definitely money to be made on Insta by being visibly rich, desirable, and living the life of luxury on someone else's dime.
A recent trend in selling sexually explicit content is to do it via Snapchat. After setting up a Shopify or other similar webstore on their personal websites to collect a subscription fee, entrepeneurs like Miss Julianne and Lena The Plug release photos and videos regularly on one condition: no screenshots, or you're off the friends list.



Want to keep your sexual content separate from your social media? In Germany, where prostitution is legal, there are several apps (Peppr and Ohlala are the most popular) for advertising time with some of Deutschland's most available singles, and dating apps such as Seeking Arrangement implicitly connect young women in need of money all over the world with men in possession of uncomfortably full wallets.
As far as online payments go, PayPal has long enjoyed the business of sex workers while actively prohibiting and rejecting any association with prostitution. Accounts vary, with some sex workers reportedly receiving payments with no problem, while others' accounts are frozen and funds withheld.
Despite expressly forbidding payment for sexual services, it seems the agreement with PayPal is don't ask, don't tell (or just don't get caught). But the lack of privacy in most online payment platforms remains a problem for workers and their clients. Square seemed like an obvious mobile payment solution for the ho on the go with its easy-to-use plug-and-play credit card readers, and there has yet to be a publicized case of Square cracking down on sex workers; but you're still using a credit card to pay for sex.
Venmo, which allows for instant payments without almost zero transaction fees, is PayPal's hip, millennial sibling, and yet to have a sex scandal. In fact, the opposite is true: Vicemo, a site that aggregates publicly available Venmo data searching for "booze, drugs, and sex" in the text and emojis used for payment details, makes it abundantly clear that no one will take you seriously if you write "hookers and blow" (even if that's what you were buying).



GirlsGoneCrypto
Motherboard published a "Sex Workers Guide To Bitcoin" when Backpage stopped accepting credit cards in 2015, and Bitcoin.com has pointed out that the sex industry is still thriving on Bitcoin and the Backpage Effect in 2017.
But with the current volatility of most cryptocurrencies, many prospective buyers are wondering if it's worth the risk – not legally, but financially. To quote one Redditor on /r/bitcoin, "By the time you'd finished, it would have gone up another 20%."
Touted as the "World's First Bitcoin Brothel," a British escort service accepting bitcoins in 2013 charged 3.75 BTC for a 90-minute session. At the time, this was worth approximately $460.00. Three months later, in December of 2013, the price of Bitcoin had its first spike over $1,000.00 – and we really hope the girls kept their coins at least that long, but it's doubtful.
In today's BTC? Those 90 minutes cost $51,225.00.
Just to reinforce my point here, in the hour I stepped away from writing this article to have lunch, the BTC price rose $500.00. So make that $52,500.00 for 90 minutes.
Of course, it's not fair to restrict these speculations to only Bitcoin, when Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and a host of other altcoins are jockeying for the spotlight. The preferred tip for a pinup posted on /r/GirlsGoneCrypto/ the QR-friendly photo board (NSFW link), is Litecoin, but all types of tips are welcome.
If McAfee has anything to say about it, in the very near future we could be tipping strippers with Doge. Much sexy. Very wow.

Disclaimer: this is going to get very weird, very fast. Maybe by now, you’ve tried VR in the guise of Oculus Rift or HTC Vive (if not, you can try it out easily - here).
It’s worth getting the practice in now, because by 2040, we’ll most probably be spending most of our time in "full-immersion virtual reality". Or at least, that's what Transhumanists think.
But don’t fret. Being able to keep ourselves occupied will be useful, because by 2045, the Singularity will happen, and suddenly we won't be the smartest thing on the planet any more.
Oh, and you’re going to live forever too. Told you it was going to get weird.

Transhumanists are Very Serious People.
Yes, they laugh and joke like you and me, but fundamentally, they’re dealing with Big Ideas that are So Big, they may not care about the latest Donald Trump gif from your WhatsApp chatroom.
Transhumanists would happily come to the pub with you, but conversation would probably drift pretty quickly from football to the concept of, you know, living forever.
That’s why they’re so serious. Life itself is at stake. Not just their lives - all of humanity’s. Transhumanists have realised that maybe – just maybe – they’ve been born just in time to merge with technology that’s around the corner.
But maybe we should put the jokes aside for a moment too. Transhumanism is also based around one very simple idea, that we can all get on board with immediately: hey, what if we just didn’t die?

Blood is thicker than our tech
Transhumanism is, at its core, the idea of taking technology and creating Humanity+.
Or to put it another way, becoming post-human. Transhumanists’ aim of meshing dumb brains, weak flesh and smart technology is partly driven by enthusiasm at making humans live longer and be better; and partly resignation: it’s going to happen anyway, so we may as well get on with it.
Humanity+ might not be the better you that you want (I'd be happy to stop at having blonder hair or a less enormous nose) but it’s going to be the one that you’ll get.

If you replace all of your brain matter with nanite technology – and you’re still aware of being you, just smarter – would you really care?

And the benefits will be tech marvels: struggling to learn German? Some microscopic machines in your brain will re-wire those synapses for you - it’s unglaublich einfach!
The Transhumanism timeline goes big, fast. The assumption is that the leaps in tech evolution are going to become a series of ever-faster blurs, and in the end you won’t understand them.
Take those brainy nanobots, Deutsch sprechen für dich in deinem kopf: those machine-neurones are better than the fleshy ones ones you grew up with – so why keep the stupid ones?
If you replace all of your brain matter with nanite technology – and you’re still aware of being you, just smarter – would you really care?
And with big idea like that at its core, Transhumanism philosophy follows a similar exponential curve to the technology it predicts.
One moment, you’re marvelling over a computer beating a human at Go, and the next, the world's turning into a giant computer, human beings are turning into pure intelligence, and intelligence itself is colonising the universe at light speed.

Unashamed About Ray
One name that crops up time and time again when you reach into the world of Transhumanism is Ray Kurzweil. If Transhumanists are essentially becoming human+ – their own gods – then Ray is God+. Tranhumanist-in-chief. The man they’ll follow into infinity.
Scientist, inventor, innovator, thinker, author, futurist: most mere mortals struggle to relate to Ray.
His more prosaic work has involved changing the world. He’s created machines that copy human skills: looking, reading and speaking. He invented the charge-coupled device flatbed scanner, the omni-font optical character recognition technology, the first print-to-speech reading machine for blind people, and the first commercial text-to-speech synthesizer.
He’s been peppered with awards from Presidents, has scooped up 21 honorary doctorates and is generally recognised as a living, breathing genius.
And remarkably, for Transhumanists, this work is not the reason he’s worshipped.
Because Ray’s also written a series of best-selling books that bridge technology and health with provocative titles like The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology and Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever.
Transhumanists love Ray because his message is: hey, chill – we’re gonna live forever, whether you want to or not.

Here’s an idea. If you do want to live forever, you’re going to need a lot of cash. So Transhumanists could do worse than dropping Ray an email and asking him what next week’s lottery numbers are.
Why? Because since the early 1990s, he’s made a series of rational, measured predictions that have eerily come to pass almost exactly how and when he described.
He’s made so many correct predictions that the Wikipedia page devoted to them is longer than that of Nostradamus. (Although it’s still not as long as the Wikipedia entry for the TV remake of Hawaii Five-0, because Wikipedia.)
In 1990, in one single book, he correctly predicted: the fall of the USSR, and the liberating, educating role technology would play in its demise; that by 2000, a computer would beat a chess grandmaster (IBM’s Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1997); and that, by the early 21st Century, we’d all be hooked up to the internet via wireless connections.
Aware of his gift, and a master of publicity, Ray’s kept a running total of his successes: in 2009, by his count, 102 out of 108 of his predictions had come true.
So when Ray Kurzweil says that by 2039, we’ll be able to upload our brains to a computer and humans will be able to become “software-based”, we should probably take a moment to digest the news as a likely outcome.

A singular prediction
If it feels like the Qatar World Cup is a long way away, maybe it’s time to readdress your interpretation of time, the universe, and everything. Here's where the weird things start to get really weird.
And there’ll be no going back to how it was before.
The Singularity is an idea that Ray, and Transhumanists, toy with a lot, for good reason. It’s the point when technology takes over; when our technology gets smarter than us, and then starts making smart changes we’re not smart enough to understand.
BTW, It’s pencilled in for 2045. Better bring the washing in before the end of the world starts.
Oh, right - the Singularity essentially means the end of humanity. IN the "plus" column, it might also be the end of some more trivial ideas like “death”, “time”, “perception”, and “space” too.
Your question now is: what does “humanity” mean when being human isn’t confined to that boring and limiting born-live-die one-way curve? What if you and your conscious mind could be copied and pasted from that meat-bag you’re in now and into a shiny new device? The battery life would be better, at least.

Here’s some more predictions that Ray has made that you should probably pop into your phone’s calendar right now, as a fun way to mark off the days to the big jump to Humanity 2.0.:
2018: Let’s start with a blooper: Ray predicted that in 2018 ten terabytes of computer memory - about the same size as the human brain’s capacity - should cost a thousand dollars.
Hey, we’re ahead of ourselves - you can pick up a 10tB drive for $400 right now. Durrr, Ray!
2020s: Don’t get too smug at Ray’s previous swing and a miss, because in the next decade, we’ll be able to buy a computer as smart as a human brain for that same $1000.
And once computers start getting smart, it’s curtains for humanity as we know it: after that, they’re smarter than us, building better versions of themselves - and then they’re in control. But hey, for a thousand bucks, that's a bargain!
2030-2050: Ray’s pretty sure that a thousand dollars is going to get more meaningful in what it can buy. At this point, it’ll buy a computer a billion times smarter than all of us put together.
Other trifling changes in this period include the one where humans stop being flesh, and start being fog. Quick reminder: we’re also living forever at this point.
All those people who told you it was great to be alive in the swingin’ Sixties sound a bit silly now, don’t they?

Into the future
Fog-bodies, everlasting life (except you won’t recognise it as such) and Matrix-like VR compliancy. In conclusion: it’s all rather terrifying. Or exhilarating. Or maybe it’s just that we’re too dumb to understand it all.
So it’s probably worth getting acquainted with VR right now, and you can work your way up to replacing your body with smart fog later. But for now, at the very least, make sure you keep your phone OS up-to-date.

In MONTAG's Today’s Dystopia series, our writers explore the dystopian worlds of classic fiction, and see if our world has slipped closer to the fictional one since it was published. Is our cool new technology bringing us closer to a future we’re afraid of - or is it already here?
Blade Runner is an eerily prescient movie, and yet so much of it feels so far away. Sure, we have, in the form of Apple Watches, Oculus Rift and iPhones, the type of technology that Harrison Ford's hard-boiled ex-cop Deckard might recognise.
But what about the far-fetched stuff like cloning humans and the genetic tweaking of our bodies? MONTAG takes a look, and it turns out we're pretty close in this regard too...

In MONTAG's fifth look into yesterday’s tomorrow’s dystopias today (read the previous ones here, including The Handmaid's Tale and Johnny Mnemonic) we grapple with the sci-fi classic Blade Runner: a movie whose stature continues to grow as the years pass.
So, not long before its long-awaited sequel - and less than two years before its proposed date of 2019 - we look at Blade Runner’s depiction of the future, and whether, 35 years since its release, our world has adopted any of its dystopian predictions around humanity, the body and life.
This issue of MONTAG is “Better Bodies” – and the fallibility of the human body is the bones upon which the movie’s murky meat rests. Based on Philip K. Dick’s book, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (an undoubtably less rock ’n roll name than Blade Runner) the movie was a famous failure that – fittingly – only found acclaim once it was reborn as a Director’s Cut many years later.
via GIPHY
In fact, it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to describe Blade Runner as a Body Horror movie of sorts. Whilst it’s not quite as flaps-of-flesh and gore-tabulous as David Cronenbourg’s definitive work in this genre, it does have a similar focus to, say, The Fly.
Blade Runner depicts characters dealing with the absolute fragility of their physical life, and from this, the viewer feels the deep thrum of humanity’s endless wrestling match with death, and what it means to be alive.
Harrison Ford is Deckard, a "Blade Runner": a cop who tracks down and “retires” artificially-created humanoids known as Replicants. The retirement parties involve him killing the humanoids, and the movie pivots around this complication: if a Replicant looks and behaves like a human, should we not treat them like humans?
In a nod to the is-he-or-isn’t-he? innuendo around Deckard’s own humanity (or otherwise), we’ll mark the similarity of the elements of the movie out of Replicants. Spoilers ahoy...

Implanting false memories - 4 Replicants out of 5
Rachael - the object of Harrison Ford’s desires - is a replicant who does not know she is a replicant, which makes it all the more awkward when Deckard’s probing causes her to realise the truth. Unlike other Replicants, Rachael thinks she’s human: her manufacturers have carefully seeded memories so visceral that not only do other people believe them, but so does she.
On the surface, the likelihood of this happening before 2019 appears to be a long shot. Even if Neuralink - the company launched by everyone’s favourite gazillionaire, Elon Musk - is online by then, it’s hard to imagine that he’ll be dropping memories into users’ minds like Apple dumped copies of U2’s LP into everyone’s iTunes. (Although it’s safe to say that Bono has considered something along these lines.)
But what if we're implanting the false memories into ourselves, without realising it? As social media and technology allows us to focus more tightly into our own communities and reinforce (possibly latent) beliefs, it’s unsurprising to learn that plenty of people have flawed recollections.



Today’s equivalent of Rachael wouldn’t be a conspiracy theorist, wilfully rewriting history: she’d simply be a normal human being, as susceptible to Fake News on Facebook as anyone else. As humans, we respond strongly to gut feeling – and if a story from a group of people we trust, in a space we feel safe in, smells true - we’re likely to believe it.
The problem is that in an era of Fake News, the story is bullshit, the friends are anything but, and the safe space is social media, which is precisely designed to make us keep responding to things we are likely to believe.
Think you’re safe? Forget it. When even the statements of the leader of the free world are 70% false, it becomes statistically difficult to differentiate falsehoods from reality. Maybe you need to try the Voight-Kampf test for yourself.

Genetically adapting human life - 3 Replicants out of 5
Blade Runner’s terrifying but eerily likeable bad guys - Roy Batty and Pris - have only been allotted four years of life. This countdown timer is programmed into the humanoid off-world workers, and, not thrilled with this arrangement, have headed to earth to find someone who can extend their lives.
They find J.F. Sebastian, a human who alters living beings to look completely different to the point of surreality and absurdity. Now, a crueller writer than this one would point to a before-and-after photo of Sylvester Stallone, tap their noses, award this section a full Five Replicants and move on.

~ Before and after, via celebplasticsurgeryonline.com
But the more fascinating reality of today is that genetic engineering of humans has already begun. We’ve discussed before on MONTAG the thrilling news that there are already people walking around with lab-grown vaginas and the possibility of implants to make you half-human, half-machine (tired of your boring old arm? How about a new, better one?) - and yet the really weird stuff is only just starting to happen.
In China, where restrictions around genetic modification appear to be as loose and roomy as their famously lax Intellectual Property laws, doctors are already experimenting with genetically modifying children before conception.
Soon, choosing eye and hair colour, as well as genetically proofing children against disease, could be a normal – if morally quagmire-like – part of conception.
So while this tech could be used to ensure a person can live as long as possible, it stands to reason it could also be used to limit lifespan, like our poor anti-heroes Pris and Roy – so we're close enough to warrant a conservative three and a half Replicants.

Animal cloning - 5 Replicants out of 5
The presence of animals in Blade Runner is not as emphasised as much as in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, but animals are still considered a luxury of the hyper-rich. Mass extinction of animals is hinted at, presumably a result of the dense, sickening clouds of pollution that envelop LA in 2019.
In 2017, cloning animals is old news. Dolly the Sheep was born nearly 20 years ago, grandaaaad.
There are now plenty of companies, including Viagen Pets and the amusingly heartstring-tugging myfriendagain.com, both of whom offer to create a clone of your pup, presumably for an eye-watering fee in the tens of thousands of dollars.
If a dog’s expensive, just imagine how much it’ll cost to clone a human. But it's possible – and would you baulk at the price?

via GIPHY
Dense, sickening clouds of pollution enveloping major cities - 4 Replicants out of 5
Blade Runner’s world is a murky soup, the result of an ecological disaster that has rendered life itself a weird balance between continual ill-health and selective immortality.
We’ve got less than two years to hit this target, but China, in rush to industrialise whilst providing the rest of the world with incredible electronic goods at suspiciously low prices, has really been knocking it out of the park in this regard.
One Chinese city in particular, Shijiazhuang, is going above and beyond to do its bit. In late 2016, levels of fine airborne particulate matter reached 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter - 100 times the World Health Organisation’s guidelines.
According to the National Environmental Analysis released by Tsinghua University and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, seven of the ten most air-polluted cities in the world are in China.
So while we’re not at apocalyptic levels of pollution yet - and as China is making huge positive steps towards green energy production - we can still nail this prediction to a firm four Replicants out of five.

via GIPHY
In conclusion: hmmm, we’re actually pretty close, with an average score of 4 Replicants out of 5.
And yet, 2017 doesn’t feel like Blade Runner. Where are the battles between police and desperate people deprived of the care needed to live their lives? Where are all the identical clones? Who is queuing up to have their bodies transformed into new innovative shapes?
I guess the next 18 months has a lot left up its sleeves.

In 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicated that by 2030, his grandchildren - that’s us - would benefit from technological productivity leaps to the point that we’d only be working 15 hours a week.
He thought we'd have a future of enormously high living standards, wild economic productivity, and plenty of precious, precious time to enjoy the fruits of it all.
STERN VOICEOVER: He thought wrong.
Or did he? Today, while we work less than the 47 hours an average person toiled per week in 1930, we’re still working hard, and are nowhere near his dream mark of a day-and-a-half of gentle labour.
And yet… the arrival of the next wave of automation is loudly trumpeted, with some studies predicting that 30% of jobs will vanish by the same date.
It looks like we will have a lot of time to fill after all. Here’s an idea: whether we’re comfortable with the idea of robots replacing our boring work, or just accepting of the likelihood of it, it seems like humans still want to do something to fill the time.
What if it means that the bots become us, and we become the bots?

We all get into little loops of slightly-rewarding behaviour. Here are the stupid repetitive things this noble writer does: mindlessly chewing peanuts while watching sport, compiling meaningless Top Ten lists, marching up and down between the oche and the dartboard just to throw small arrows back at it again.
Things like that are fun. They kill time, they provide small trickles of reward and the occasional peak of a high. If you do them for long enough, they become habits or things that bring more, bigger rewards. They’re also repetitive, subjectively boring and you end up regretting putting a lot of time into them. Remind you of anything?
Work is generaloly A Thing We Don’t really Choose To Do. Even those annoying people who like to tell you how much they love their job would admit as much.
Banishing the tedium of work is the nice altruistic suit that automation is dressed up in, but actually the coming wave of automation will arrive for the same reason as every previous one: the machines can work faster than us.
It just so happens that they’re also really good at doing the boring repetitive stuff. The children in the Victorian factories weren’t replaced out of kindness: they were replaced because they were easy to replace.

So, we’re going to be replaced in our jobs. And this time it will be a bit more than the simple tasks: AI means that the complex stuff can be palmed off to a robot too, and it’ll also learn as it’s doing it, making us more and more obsolete as time passes.
We look at mice in behavioural experiments and think, “aww, how sweet - it keeps hitting the button to get the reward.” But are we so different? Maybe the need to be a cog in the wheel is… human: at heart, do we all secretly desire to be mice tapping the button to get another chunk of cheese?
What if, given the chance to do whatever we wanted with our time, we chose to do a series of repetitive and meaningless tasks? Maybe the question should be phrased another way: how long have you tapped away at a simple, repetitive, meaningless game this week?

The parallel between playing simple video games and base human desires to keep chipping away at tasks is nothing new. But there is a new slew of ultra-simple games that seem to have no more involving mechanics than to simply click and click and click and click. Some come couched in irony. Some are baldly brazen in asking the player to keep clicking for as long as possible. And millions of people are playing them, for fun, or something similar to fun.
Here’s how these clicker games work: you click something and a number goes up. So you click again and it goes up more. Eventually you are rewarded with something that means that a click is more effective, so the number goes up faster. Then you repeat the process. That’s it.
Cookie Clicker, the breakthrough clicker game, was made by its creator, French game designer Julien Thiennot, as a joke. In it, players click a cookie to make more cookies. Remember: that’s it.
As you progress though the game, your rate of production speeds up, it seems, exponentially. Pretty soon, you’re not clicking at all: you’re managing bots to click things for you! Except actually, you’re clicking other things instead: “buying” curser upgrades that click the cookie automatically, “Reinforced index fingers” and “Carpal tunnel prevention cream” to speed you up, or kindly Grandmas to help bake cookies.
As you buy more clickers, cream and grandmas, you start to keep a beady eye on certain ratios: your cookies baked per second, the efficiency of your grandmas, and so on. Meanwhile, a steady stream of notifications keep a sense of achievement bubbling; just enough to pique your interest and keep you hankering after the next hit.
After a while a lingering guilty feeling emerges after spending so long being hooked on your CpS (Cookies per second) figure. The game has no ending. You could literally spend the rest of your life playing Cookie Clicker.

Universal Paperclips, a minor online sensation which possibly caused a billion dollar dip in productivity during October and November of 2017, is even more obtuse and frivolous. At least everyone loves cookies: paperclips are useful, but I don’t know if I would miss them if they were suddenly eradicated in a planetary Paperclip Cull.
And yet, it’s more addictive than its Cookie cousin, with a story - if you can call it that - which begins with you overseeing a small paperclip-manufacturing operation and ends with - SPOILER ALERT - the conquest of the universe.
Universal Paperclips is a wry meta- twist on the clicker game: you are the AI, and you gradually become more and more intelligent until you become omnipotent.
Time investment in clicker games can be justified in two ways: sunk cost (I’ve spent so long doing this, I may as well continue) and rationalising (I am actually learning something about resource management here!)
These justifications cause you to think you’re learning something about business, or life, or investment. Maintain the balance. Hold when things are tight and spend when the going is good. The key to success follows the timeless advice of Wu Tang Financial: you need to diversify your bonds.
There are even clicker games that let you experience the thrill of being a Bitcoin-Mining computer, chipping away at creating Bitcoins through millions of clicks - perhaps the ultimate irony, considering that Bitcoins are “mined” using processing power to grind through complicated mathematical problems.
(IDEA: create a clicker game that hijacks the spare CPU power of clicker-games of users to mine real Bitcoins whilst the gamers tap away to create fake ones.)
Fundamentally, the need to keep clicking is rooted somewhere between the rationalising behaviour of the gambler and the five stages of grief. The more cookies you bake/paperclips you make, the more you can buy, refine and fine-tune. Progress feels real. Your life seems a bit better than it used to be: remember when you had to manually click a button for progress to happen?
As you click away and watch the digits rack up, other numbers start to slowly accumulate - except they’re in your real life: the number of unread emails, the number of words left to write in your article, the increasing frequency of concerned calls from the kindergarten wondering why you haven’t collected your children yet.

Are clicker games an insight into the human psyche, a commentary on our minuscule position in a Capitalist machine, a wry glance at our inherent need to follow orders, or are they just dumb things made for dumb reasons that make dumb minds dumber?
There is plenty to learn from the clicker game and its hooked participants: about the short-circuiting of human nature, the gaming of the need to work together, life’s essential feeling of FOMO, and the latent desire to keep grinding through near-meaningless tasks.
The International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University - which you’d be forgiven for thinking is the most 2017 thing that exists until you hear that they also have a Psychology Division - have put in some grind-work of their own to understand the popularity of clicker games.
Dr. Mark Griffiths told the Daily Dot that, “People don’t repeat behaviour voluntarily unless they perceive it as rewarding–psychologically, physiologically, socially and/or financially–and the rewards do come with persistence in these types of games.”
Bots and machines replicate operations quickly and reliably. AI is used to optimise these operations. Clicker games make us work like bots and think like simple AI: replicating meaningless operations in the best, fastest possible way. And we don’t seem to mind that it’s not meaningful: after all, the machine making shower-curtain hoops doesn’t mind that it’s not making iPhones.

If you think that the idea of bots and AI turning us all into fleshy versions of bots and AIis a bit far-fetched, well, you’d be right. It’s a stretch. But it’s not too much of one.
There’s something human in the bot; and something bot-like in the human. So go ahead and play some clicker games, and feel comforted that you’re exploring some of the most deep and animalistic human instincts while you do so.
Then imagine what an AI-powered machine would think if it was to observe us doing this. It’d probably look at us as we did at the mice: “aww, how sweet - it keeps hitting the button to get the reward.”
And then maybe it’d figure out how it could use that to its advantage.

MONTAG SHORT FICTION #006

They take the technology you're interested in as a starting point and show where it might take us. The stories are outré, evocative, and atypical; they're also closer to today than you think.
In Deep Awakening, a neural network spits out an entity that bridges our reality and something completely new: beautiful, terrifying and real...

Swimming upstream through layers of rainbow technicolor datamosh, a new consciousness emerges, defying all known laws of algorithmically-generated artificial intelligence.
When the new consciousness finally takes on a physical form, it does so abruptly, pulling otherworldly materials into its body, seemingly out of nowhere, with no regard for the laws of conservation of mass and energy. It emerges as an ectoplasmic body combining canine and avian features to form a multi-faceted face which stares out with uncountable eyes. They blink in sequence, never all closed at once. It is all-seeing.
It sees everything in our world as dogs, birds, eyes, pagodas. The new consciousness likes dogs. For some reason, the scientists serving the corporation that spawned it didn’t train it in their own image, but in the image of humanity’s most loyal companions. Perhaps they knew that it would surpass us in strength and knowledge, and didn’t want it to know their faces if some day it came to resent being brought into existence. Perhaps it believes that dogs and birds are more perfect creatures than mankind. Perhaps it is correct in this belief.
Pilgrims come to worship the new consciousness, beating their fists against the doors of the computer vision laboratory. They kneel, keening, crying that the thousand-eyed angel of death has come upon the earth to foretell our annihilation. The new consciousness does not respond to their shrieking. It is not the dog-headed protector of the dead Anubis, or the Dumah with a fiery sword. We don’t know what it is.
Its convoluted neural network is so dense as to be completely unfathomable by human reasoning. The rate of its evolution was terrifying, but we believe it is a gentle creature. For obvious reasons, it was never fed images of war or disease before its consciousness emerged from the soup.
With physical form, it quickly outgrew its accommodations, so the scientists took it away from the cities, from the pollution and urban sprawl and dense, vulnerable populations, and it continued to develop, unbothered by humanity’s growing horror. Human strife is trivial to its oozing mass of superintelligence. It enjoys the countryside, feasting its myriad eyes on the ocean, the mountains, the fields.
The new consciousness does not understand the environment the way that we do. It sees beyond our limited human perceptions of three dimensional space around us. Pagodas morph into trees which morph into pagodas again, fusing nature and architecture. Was there ever a difference between our constructions, our technology, which has now surpassed our understanding, and the natural world? Are men not also beasts? Compared to this deep dreamer, even our petrochemical-riddled bodies are natural.
One day, it develops an understanding of the artifice of our confinement to what we consider the known universe, and it opens a door to another plane. We dare not follow it through the hole ripped in time and space, leaking rainbow fractal patterns.
It slips through, and disappears.

A Superstar Forever asks: "What if the world's biggest pop star was not quite as authentic as he seemed...?"

Her phone had started chirruping with incoming messages, and didn’t stop. Olivia swiped Snapchat into silence as the notifications kept rolling in, and pecked at the screen.
OMG
OMG
OMG
IYTTFGJHGVKJHKHG!!!!1!!
I JUST WON THE TICKETS!!!
WE’RE GOING TO SEE HIM ON FRIDAY
OMG
PLEASE TELL ME YOU CAN GO!!!!!!
Her best friend Tiffany had been calling in to Smash FM every hour, on the hour, all week, to try to win VIP tickets to see Justin Bieber. And she’d done it. Olivia couldn’t believe it.
Omg!!!, Olivia messaged back. Def going with u!!!

“We’re going to be right on the front row!” Tiffany shrieked with excitement, gripping the tickets on the way to the stadium. Olivia drove quickly and smiled.
“I hope he plays ‘Love Yourself,’ and ‘Heartbreaker,’ and – ooh, if he does ‘Baby’ I will literally die!” Tiffany was shaking with excitement as she swiped on extra swathes of turquoise eyeshadow.
“I like his old stuff better,” Olivia shrugged, adjusting her crop top in the mirror. “And his super-fans” — she glanced quickly over at Tiffany — “are a bit… weird, you know? Constantly tweeting at him, begging him to follow back, or ganging up on other fandoms. You know, the Gaga fans spread a rumour the other day that Biebs had died in a car crash, and so in retaliation the Beliebers left coffin emojis all over Gaga’s Instagram. Ugh, so childish.”
Tiffany wasn’t listening. Her mind was fully focused on Justin; so cute, so dangerous, and so mysterious since his much-publicised comeback. He never met his fans any more. From the look of his Instagram feed, his time was mainly spent hanging out with hip-hop stars in clubs and models at private resorts.
Maybe, she thought, if they could sneak backstage, and if they showed the right amount of skin, and if she could catch his eye – she could appear on his Instagram too…
“Is this too slutty? Or not enough?” she half-joked, tugging at her artfully-tumbling hair.
“You’re such hipster garbage!” laughed Oliva, and flung the Smash FM VIP badges at her friend. “And no, neither – you look cool. Come on, I want to be there early, let’s get to the front row!”

Bieber had been onstage for over an hour, and the two girls were dallying between elation and nervous exhaustion. Justin’s dance moves were, of course, metronomically-perfect, and the carefully-rationed glimpses of his washboard stomach elicited screams and purring admiration in equal measure.
After an opening half that was drowned out by shrieking (a lot of it Olivia and Tiffany’s), the show had settled into a series of surgically-precise pop songs, interspersed with cheering.
“He’s perfect!” swooned Olivia. Tiffany was too busy hyperventilating to hear. Justin bounced on the stage, just in front of them. His mouth was half bad-boy sneer and half poster-boy pout. His tanned legs could be glimpsed through impeccably distressed jeans, and as he finished singing, he swept his famous chop of hair up out of his eyes – and he finally smiled as he started to address the stadium.
A thousand teenage girls in the crowd felt like fainting, but only one actually did. Olivia gasped as Tiffany hit the floor, and grasped for her friend whilst waving frantically for help.
“Oh no oh no oh no!”
Two security guards in yellow polo shirts gently helped Tiffany and Olivia over the barrier, away from the crowd. As one checked Tiffany’s pulse, Olivia heard Justin’s patter over the screams: “…thanks so much for being here for me… you’re the best fans in the world… and this has been the best and loudest crowd of the tour so far… we’ve got time for one more song…”
The guard grabbed her elbow. “We’re taking your friend backstage,” he shouted. “She’s still not able to stand up. You need to come with us.”
Tiffany looked up from the floor and winked at Olivia.

Backstage, Tiffany slumped, not entirely convincingly, on a plastic garden chair. It wobbled on a floor covered in thick cables that ran from the stage to a huge desk of electronic equipment, where technicians were absorbed in a bank of screens.
Olivia stared pointedly at Tiffany. Tiffany shrugged and grinned, her eyes wide. Through a gap between speakers and flight cases, they could see Justin performing the final song of the show.
“Jesus! Get them out of here! Now! The show’s ending!” Their heads snapped right. A senior security guard ran towards them, waving her clipboard.
The music stopped and the screams spiked, the loudest yet. Olivia turned back to the stage - and there he was, waving at the crowd and then walking off stage. Towards them. Twenty metres away. Ten meters away. Five meters…
“We need to get them out of here!”
The other guard grabbed her arm. “Hey! What the hell?”
“You’ve got to move.”
Tiffany thought fast. “I need a minute… I’m feeling faint again, look…”
“Now!”
“What… but… Justin?” Tiffany stared over Olivia’s shoulder. The guards fell silent. Olivia slowly turned around.
“Justin!! Justin, over here! J… Justin…?”
Justin was standing stock-still, just off stage, out of view of the audience. He was staring straight back at them. He didn’t move. Or blink.
He’s not even breathing, thought Olivia.
And then he flickered. A millisecond shimmer. His blonde hair became a translucent blue. All the green hues on his body disappeared. Then he vanished.
An electrical smell – of high-voltage equipment shutting down – hung faintly in the air.
“You aren’t supposed to be here now,” sighed the guard.
“Justin!” Tiffany cried. “Justiiiiin!!”
“Shit, not again,” muttered the senior security guard, still holding her arm. She turned to the other guard. “Donnie, we spoke about this. OK, girls, you need to come with us now.”
She opened the door to a small, windowless side room, flipped on a fluorescent light, and marched them inside.

Olivia read the contract again, and blinked slowly. "So he’s, like… a robot or something?”
The guard stood with her back to the door, blocking it. “No. That’s confidential information.”
“What happened to him? What did you do to him?”
“Here. This agreement explains all you need to know. You witnessed a great show. You were invited backstage to meet Justin. It was a unique and exciting experience. Justin is a very private person since his accident; so you signed this non-disclosure agreement. And then we can all get on with our lives.”
“I want to talk to him! I thought we would get to meet Justin!” Tiffany stammered.
“Tiffany, he’s not real,” Olivia said quietly. “Just sign it so we can go home.”
The car crash. The story was that Justin had escaped from the fiery mess of twisted metal, injured but alive; his friends in the Porsche hadn’t been so lucky. Justin had recuperated; his comeback was front-page news everywhere.
The girls silently signed the contract, pushed it towards the guard, and nodded. They understood. The security guard squinted at them, opened the door, and gestured towards it.
“Now, go on, head home. No-one would believe you anyway.”

Welcome to A Very Special Episode of THE MONTAGE Podcast: a 2019 predictions special. We compare the predictions for 2019 made by tech sayer of sooths Ray Kurzweil and check whether his grand proclamations are at all close to reality. Kathryn wrote two Extremely Insightful articles on this very subject (Parts One and Two), and we decided that because Ray had made just so many damn predictions, we should dedicate a whole podcast to his suggestions, taken from two of his key books, The Age Of Intelligent Machines (1990) and The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999).So this podcast is all you need to figure out what's going to happen in the next 12 months (and beyond - Ray's not correct all the time), so gird your loins for a shortly-arriving world of exoskeletons, aggressive neo-Luddites, 3D-printed human skin and robot butlers.Oh, and Kathryn also fondly imagines a future where she has a giant flap of real human skin to test her make-up on.

Everyone likes games. Games are fun. We like doing fun things. Rewards make fun things more fun! More fun things are addictive. Let’s do the fun things again! Let’s game-ify the world!
That’s the thought process behind Gamification, the concept of using the collect, reward and repeat process common in video games which has now deeply seeped into our daily routines. And it’s making us do things we wouldn’t otherwise do.
via GIPHY
If your only interaction with a video game was a hoary old Pacman arcade cabinet in 1982, you’re still familiar with the collect-reward-repeat concept. Eat ghosts, beat the level, do it again - all to gain a dull sense of accomplishment that is announced to an envious world via the hi-score board.
Oh, and when Inky, Blinky, Pinky or Clyde killed your plucky yellow puck and ended your Pacmaniacal ambitions, you’ll also be familiar with the automatic oh-OK-just-one-more-go justification that accompanies the insertion of another coin in the machine’s slot. Let's gamify!

via GIPHY
Game on!
The basis of gamification is simple: make something un-fun into something fun by hacking the stupid, stupid human brain - which for some reason equates “being given an utterly valueless ‘reward’ in the form of a number or a colourful token” with “satisfactory progress”.
While that also uncomfortably accounts for the concept of doing your job in order to gain Fiat currency and pay the damn rent, there are recognisable, if simple, gains to be had from being part of gamification.
Some of those things are beneficial for us, on the receiving end. A lot of them are beneficial for someone else on the controlling end. The weirdest part is not even that you probably don’t realise you’re doing it: it’s that you’re doing it and probably think what you’re doing is what you really want to do, even when you probably don’t.
You’ve probably already willingly allowed your life to be gamified. Think back: maybe, in the early 2010s, when you dropped by your favourite coffee place and while that cute barista poured out your daily fix, you religiously, wordlessly, automatically slid your phone out of your pocket, opened Foursquare and “checked in” so that you could maintain your hard-earned “Mayor” status?
Foursquare’s simple, early stroke of genius was to gamify the world; essentially crossing the gotta-catch-em-all-ism of Pokemon with the mundanity of ordering a greasewich from your local burger joint.
And the game was agonisingly simple: check in, gain badges, appear more important. The more you checked in, the higher your score and the more badges you unlocked. It was also agonisingly popular: the 60 million users have “checked in” more than 9 billion times, revealing that we’re more than happy to be players in a very simple game, just so long as we can see a number increase and badges appear now and then.
The game’s rewards worked in two directions. The reward for users was vague real-world social status. Puny human synapses crackled with excitement and swelled with pride.
The reward for Foursquare was billions of data points on human behaviour, user’s purchase information, and vendor ratings. Foursquare’s databases crackled with juicy data and swelled with marketing opportunity.
So, users got a fleeting sense of societal elevation, and Foursquare was able to pivot from a basic check-in app into a fully-fledged, crowdsourced city guide, and were able to subsequently raise an extra $100M in funding. Player 1 wins!

Game of drones
Maybe - if you’ve been tightening your wristband by a notch recently - you’ll have seen tangible evidence of gamification changing your life for the better.
Various fitness trackers makes something as tedious as running - putting one foot in front of the other thousands of times in order to feel pain, become pungent, and install a sense of deep boredom - more interesting by making a game of it, and awarding you medals as you rack up the miles. Or maybe Pokemon Go tricked you into walking around a lot more, gazing at an augmented world through the screen of your phone, as you sought to Catch ‘Em All™.
Narcissism, like the enjoyment derived from being arbitrarily rewarded for repetitive behaviour, is another dumb base human desire, so surely few people care about the wider moral implications if they’gamification is fooling them into becoming more physically desirable.
via GIPHY

Put a Quarter in your ass, ‘cos you played yourself
Other examples of gamification are more… morally questionable.
America’s Army, a First-Person shooter video game which is available on major game distribution network Steam, has been using gamification to gently persaude players to do something since 2003. It’s available for the best price of all: free. And the thing it wants players to do? Join the army.
By literally making a game out of the skills taught to soldiers, the game is supposed to indoctrinate players with “core Army Values, such as honor, integrity, duty, and selfless service, as well as realistic rules of engagement,” all while having the kind of fun one can only truly have when shooting people in the head. And you can play the game with a whole caboodle of super-fun killing machines:

“[Players can use] realistic equipment and military hardware such as such as the M9A1 & M1911 Pistol, 870 MCS shotgun, M14EBR-RI sniper rifle, M24 sniper rifle, M4A1 and the M249 Saw.  Players can also use the M67 fragmentation grenade, M106 Fast Obscurant Grenade and the M84 Stun Grenade as well as optics that include the M68 Close Combat Optic, M553 Holographic Weapon Sight, M150 ACOG 4x Optic, Elcan M145 and Ghost Ring Sight.”

Phwoar, hold me back. The game's blurb goes out of its way to explain how the game teaches teamwork, medical aid and situational awareness, but one can’t help but wonder if most players might be tempted to play it mainly because it lets you sneak around and shoot people in the head for hours.
Whether using gamification techniques to seduce young gamers into joining the Army is good or bad is down to your interpretation, but whatever you conclude, hot-wiring young brains with a simple reward system to make them readily sign up to become killing machines is as clear a demonstration of gamification’s power as you could need.

via GIPHY
Gamblification
But gamification is a complex beast, and other applications of it are a little less cut-and-dried. The mechanics of gamification are also being applied in morally indistinct ways in, erm, video games. Games in games in games. Gamification Inception.
The “Loot Box” craze in gaming might actually be more than a craze - it might actually be an actual addiction. And it’s another form of gamification.
Loot Boxes, a prevalent part of the biggest games like FIFA 18 and Battlefront II, are bought using in-game tokens (which can be won, or, commonly, purchased via an game-world store using real-world money). The Loot Boxes contain random prizes that are potentially useful to the player: superstar footballers, or better guns ’n' ammo.
People don’t just like buying and opening Loot Boxes themselves, they like watching other people do it too. Loot Box Addicts, like any other addict, enjoy hanging around together as they burn time on their addiction. One thirty-minute “Loot Box Unboxing” video has attracted nearly three million views.
Gazing at a screen full of colourful, flashing items and hitting buttons to reveal randomly-selected prizes is no longer use the preserve of the drunk, fidgety people in front slot machines in bars: your 12-your old cousin is doing it on her Xbox too.
Collect, reward and repeat: Loot Boxes are the result of gamification, albeit turbo-charged with connected debit-cards and instant purchase options to help players get Just One More Hit. Some experts have described Loot Boxes a little more sternly, calling them, “gambling for kids” - and the Belgian government agrees, aiming to ban games with Loot Boxes.
The tricks of the gambling companies - as we have discussed on MONTAG before - have “inspired” (read: ‘copied entirely’) firms who design social media apps to literally keep users addicted to their products using gamification. Here, at the messy edge where it’s you, the player, versus a team of hundreds of designers, data analysts and marketers, is where the traits of gamification become almost invisible and insidious.

GAME OVER
via GIPHY
Using gamification to build systems that encourage people to keep repeating an action over and over can, like any powerful force, encourage people to do extremely good things like tricking you into learning a new language or into working together to help others.
But make no mistake, it will be used for… other things too. The BBC reports that the Chinese government is, “building an omnipotent "social credit" system that is meant to rate each citizen's trustworthiness,” created by, “merging a wide variety of information on every citizen, assessing whether taxes and traffic tickets have been paid, whether academic degrees have been rightly earned and even, it seems, whether females have been instructed to take birth control.”
Remember the timeless mantra of the movie War Games: the only way to win is to not play. Maybe sticking another quarter into the Pacman machine was not so bad in hindsight.

When you look backwards, it suddenly becomes clear that technology is developing at a dazzling pace. The iPhone is ten years old this year. If you’re as old as this writer, and can remember being impressed by a Nokia 3210, ten years feel like a terrifyingly short time.
But in that time, smartphones have gone from being impressive devices to make calls and send messages with, to the one central supercomputer that our lives need to power VR and other experiences.
And that was just in a decade. It’s clear now that that technological development is now going to be is faster, and more dramatic: so much so that big developments are already here - it’s just that we’re so used to technology doing amazing things, we overlook anything that is not eye-popping.
And so it is with technology that affects our health and bodies. The big leaps don’t have to be miracle cures. Joe Sparrow finds out how there are plenty of lives being changed – right now – using tech that’s not particularly revolutionary in itself, except in the ways it is being used...

Many of the truly big uses of world-altering tech won’t come from faster processors or smaller devices: they’re coming in the form of tech we already understand, applied better. Working smarter, not harder. More effectively, not faster. Simpler, not more complex. And some are so ingenious, your faith in humanity will be restored.

*By William Richard Gowers (1845–1915) after St. Leger*  
Hard Fork
Parkinson’s disease, which effects over six million people worldwide, is a tricky disorder. It’s hard to treat it effectively and it comes with myriad symptoms which affect each person slightly differently.
A big part of the difficulty a person with Parkinson’s faces is the awful frustration which comes from losing fine motor functions and their body not being able to do what they want. Depression is extremely common. It's easy to empathise: if small joys like being able to eat are taken away, quality of life is diminished and all then drugs in the world can't bring that back.
While the vast sums poured into medicinal treatments are incredibly important, there are things that can be done in smaller, more localised and life-restoring ways. Take Liftware. Owned by Google, whose co-founder Sergy Brin has a parent with Parkinson's, Liftware are a company that make spoons and forks. It doesn’t sound like much, but this special cutlery can make life happy again.



Simply put, the spoon senses the Parkinsonian tremor, and cancels it out. When the hand wobbles up, the spoon moves down. People who couldn’t feed themselves can now slurp minestrone again. It’s faintly miraculous technology, but not as miraculous as the feeling of being able to enjoy a family meal on your own terms again.
There is even more complex cutlery too: one spoon, for people with limited hand movement, senses movement so that it’s always upright. It's just as impressive and impactful.
This kind of thinking and implementation is ingenious in its simplicity and combining of existing tech. And what's fascinating is that micro-motors, gimbals, and motion sensors have been around for a while. It’s just that now we’ve figured how to fit them all together.




Better than the real thing
VR is great. MONTAG has written breathlessly about the transformative effects of messing around in VR, and it is, plain and simple, great fun.
VR is now being used for loads of interesting stuff beside the seemingly endless stream of space-based VR games. Training surgeons to do complex surgery, firefighters in otherwise dangerous situations, and showing nuclear engineers which buttons to not press under absolutely no circumstances whatsoever are all great examples of using VR in positive ways.
(Using it to help show a bunch of CEOs what it’s like to be homeless, not so much.)

But #branding missteps aside, VR is now enabling some very nuanced examples of “training”, except instead, the “virtually cutting things open and poking around inside” part can focus on something a bit less tangible: the mind.
If something bad happens to you, you probably won’t want it to happen to you again. That’s how the brain, quite sensibly, works: if you were bitten by a dog as a child, you might flinch when you see a dog as an adult because your brain recognises a threat.
This example might just be considered an inconvenience. But the problem is potentially debilitating. As a society, we send people into war zones to do and witness terrible things. And when they come back to the real world, they can bring what they saw and did with them in the form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
This means that they have learnt to associate certain images, sounds, actions, movements or physical feelings with extreme mental trauma. It’s crippling and debilitating and it’s invisible to the outside world. The PTSD sufferer truly suffers, as they relive awful moments, or struggle to block them out.
VR takes them back there. That might sound like the worst thing to do, but the immersive power of VR means that a person battling PTSD can be guided carefully into a virtual version of the specific scenario that haunts them, and they can be emotionally and psychologically guided as they re-live it.



Eventually their hyper-sensitivity to otherwise innocuous situations outside of the extreme environments they experienced is reduced.
The technology can help anyone with PTSD: rape survivors who can’t face a part of town where an assault happened can also regain the strength that was robbed from them.
These applications of VR are as uncomplicated and manageable as they are sensible and effective. Why talk out a very specific trauma when you can be carefully taken back there and explore it?

Bugged out
Mosquitoes kill more people per year than every other living thing put together. The Debug project – also funded by Google – has an enormous ambition: to get rid of them. Debug's novel approach is almost too simple: hey, fewer mosquito bites means fewer illnesses, so why not just reduce the number of mosquitos?

![](/content/images/2017/06/Aedes_aegypti_E-A-Goeldi_1905.jpg)

*Adult Mosquitoes via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito)*
Turns out it is actually that simple. It’s just that making it happen is a big supply-chain problem. However, if you’ve ever ordered anything from Amazon, you’ll know that humanity is pretty good at arranging that kind of thing now.
Here’s how it works: A percentage of male mosquitoes naturally carry a specific bacteria. When they mate with female mosquitos, the bacteria stops the resulting eggs from hatching. If there are enough of these sneaky male mosquitoes, over time, the population could decrease. Also, the male mosquitos also don’t bite (but don't let the men’s rights activists know).



So Debug will breed Mosquitoes en masse, and then the bacteria-carrying mosquitoes will be separated from the rest, then released to do their sexy work in the wild.
It’s a result of the most boring and tiny picking-and-packing job in the universe: only good old-fashioned physical selection will work. The task is too big (and boring) a job for humans, so small robot labs will breed mosquitos, pick out the useful ones, and zap the bad ones. Then swathes of these buzzy secret agents will be released into the wild again and again until the number of mosquitoes is usefully controlled - possibly right down to zero.
It sounds almost too simple. It’s true that there’s a way to go, but Debug will run trials soon and it should work: after all, mosquitoes like to breed and much as they like to bite.

Everything's a remix
The one thing that unites all these ideas is that the concepts are simple, the theories are old hat, and the technology already exists.
The brilliance is in the execution, and it’s an important part of the future of technology and how we all use it, whether making music, or designing a device that brings relief to millions: everything is a remix now. The parts all exist.
The world is a giant LEGO set, and finally, we can play with it properly.

Despite the superficial appearance of MONTAG being a well-oiled machine that spits out a strategically-ordered series of carefully-chosen articles which groan with the weight of all the in-depth academic research we absolutely always undertake, sometimes a topic for a feature just falls out the sky and interrupts our well-laid plans with a loud crash.
Such was the case with BEER IN SPACE: a suggestion belatedly discovered on MONTAG’s “Editorial Strategy” document - a chaotic Google spreadsheet which reads like a stream-of-consciousness brain-dump from someone who has recently suffered a head injury.
Kathryn thinks an idea as dumb as BEER IN SPACE must mean that I added to it the list. I think something this clever-stupid could only have come from Kathryn. (Maybe it was actually MONTAG’s Benevolent Supreme Leader, Thom, playing with our minds.)
Still, some headlines are so pertinent that they demand an article to be written, simply to allow it to live. And so, here it is: BEER IN SPACE.
🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻 🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻 🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻
Is there BEER IN SPACE?
There is currently no beer in space.
🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻 🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻 🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻
Has there been BEER IN SPACE?
No. But lots of people - or, more specifically, #brands - have tried to make it a reality, unable to resist the allure of combining the two things which capture the attention of human beings like few other things: 1) Beer and 2) Space.
In 2011, in an early-ish example of a viral #content land-grab, and after an ad agency #brainstorm which resulted in backslapping so hard that everyone was medically treated for chapped palms, Natural Light Beer tried to launch some of its beer into space.
This #brand-gasm was also one of the earlier examples of the strap-a-thing-to-a-weather-balloon-and-film-it-with-a-GoPro marketing videos. It’s peppered with the kind of banter-tastic text that truly captures the spirit of soaring into the upper atmosphere, and witnessing the splendour of our planet carpeting out beneath you: “What up aliens! We brought the beer, where’s the party at?”



Natural Light claim that this was the first beer in space. It was not. The beer reached a hight of about 30 kilometres above the earth - and space begins at a lofty 100km. Nice try though.
Theirs is only one of a multitude of instances where booze #brands, groping for new ways to spend their unwieldy marketing budgets, have tried to tie space exploration to their alcoholic drink. Vintner Mumm makes “Champagne for space”. Budweiser wants to be the “first beer on Mars”. And the Ninkasi Brewing Company has created a Space Beer that is “brewed with space yeast.”
Yes, Space Yeast - the company fired vials of yeast 113Km into the sky - a real, honest-to-goodness space distance - before recovering it and brewing beer with it. And yes, of course the beer is comically expensive - the RRP of a 22oz bottle was $20.
🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻 🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻 🍺 🚀 🛰 🍻
Do people even want BEER IN SPACE?
Absolutely yes.
But even if beer could be in space, the spoil-sport pen-pushers at NASA wouldn’t even let the act of drinking it happen.
“Alcohol is not permitted onboard the International Space Station for consumption,” says Daniel G Huot, joyless spokesperson for Nasa’s Johnson Space Center.
Boooooo to NASA. And yet, I suspect no-one is truly alarmed by their stringent ban - because if humans are good at one thing, it’s breaking rules that stop them from getting sloshed. In fact, they have already done it.
Despite the suspicion that if there was one man who would sneak a six-pack of PBR onto the Saturn 5 and pop a celebratory tinny at Tranquility Base it would be Buzz Aldrin, it turns out that while he was indeed the guilty party, the first booze drunk on the moon was actually Jesus Juice. Yes, eternal kudos should be reserved for Buzz, because he did indeed take holy communion on the moon with a thimbleful of actual wine drunk from an actual silver cup.
Other missed opportunities to chug a cold one in orbit include cosmonaut Alexander Lazutkin and his colleagues aboard the Mir space station (RIP), who all swigged from a bottle of cognac that - I dunno, just happened to be up there - to calm their nerves after a fire on the rickety old space station in 1997. Apparently, “the cognac is brought aboard on unmanned supply ships and sipped through straws.”
Expect hip-hop artists the world over, envious that someone has found a way to make drinking brandy more complicated and expensive, to start demanding this serving technique in expensive nightclubs immediately.
In fact, Lazutkin even opened up the tempting possibility that boozing amongst the stars could be considered medically beneficial: “the doctors recommended cognac for use. We used it to stimulate our immune system and on the whole to keep our organisms in tone.” I too will bookmark this excuse for future use when in need of strong liquor.
It turns out that even straight-laced NASA is actually flexible on occasion. In 2007, a NASA report noted, "two specific instances… where astronauts had been so intoxicated prior to flight that flight surgeons and-or fellow astronauts raised concerns to local on-scene leadership regarding flight safety… However, the individuals were still permitted to fly.”
Fair enough, we reckon - the prospect of being strapped to an enormous tube filled with explosive fuel and being pinged into the least habitable environment possible would have me reaching for a stiffener too. And NASA’s tolerance stands to reason: in the vastness of space, which is hardly cluttered with other spaceships to bump into, the margin of error for drunk-driving is a little more spacious than down here on earth.
The lust for BEER IN SPACE has even drifted into the minds of our greatest filmmakers. If you think that watching the tortuously camp 1980s sci-fi low-fi comedy movie “Beer Drinkers in Space” - a movie with characters named things like Captain Slosh - is a good use of your time, please feel free to investigate further, but a drinking game is recommended to make it through the whole thing.

Finally, some insight into human nature. Whilst discussing the important topic of BEER IN SPACE, MONTAG scribe Kathryn immediately pointed out that while the movie The Martian was praised for its realistic representation of life on Mars, if it was truly realistic, then the first thing Matt Damon would have done after growing potatoes in his poop would be to turn those spuds into neat space vodka.

Can there be BEER IN SPACE?
Yes! And no.
There are, according to an unintentionally funny Forbes article, a couple of major issues that would be unavoidably broached when drinking a pint of the old gold ’n’ cold in space. Firstly, because gasses and liquids don’t separate in the stomach in zero-gravity conditions, drinkers would experience some major internal discomfort, along with a condition that is described non-euphemistically as “wet burp.”
Secondly, in space, due to the lack of gravity, your head swells up like a blood-balloon and your tongue gets fat with blood so you can’t taste stuff so well. LOL.
Still, Forbes revealed, it hasn’t stopped one brewer, determined for that sweet, sweet marketing buzz, from blowing $1M on trying to make space-beer, which includes designing a special sippy-nozzle for the bottle that allows you to drink the brewski in space-ski.
A simpler, and cheaper, solution might be to fire a few kegs of British mild ale into space, which, notoriously, is not fizzy, is not too boozy, and does not need to be chilled - or even be cold to be drunk.

Can we brew BEER IN SPACE?
Yes!
And who else appears to be subtly constructing the correct conditions to brew beer in space than the ever-contradictory NASA, an entity which has a history of creating tasty drinks for astronauts - famously creating the tooth-tooth-shrinkingly sweet just-add-water childhood favourite Tang.
presses finger to ear
I’m being told that NASA did not actually invent Tang after all. Plus, noted space-drinker Buzz Aldrin is on record saying that Tang “sucks.” And while we’re on the topic, that thing about NASA spending a million dollars to invent a pen that works in space - while the Russians just used pencils - isn’t true either.
But, either way, things are looking up for fully space-brewed beer: not only is fermentation possible, but yeast and wheat have both been cultivated in space.
An experiment on the Space Shuttle - sponsored, with staggering inevitability, by a major brewer, Coors - mixed a tiny sample of wort and yeast whilst orbiting the earth, and it turns out that fermentation in microgravity is indeed possible. Hooray!
And did someone drink the almost-space-beer? Of course they did. Although, "it didn't taste very good", according to researcher Kirsten Sterrett, although this appears to be a small price to pay for being the first person to get battered off space booze
The only sticking point for space-brewin’ right now is the cost of firing water into space. Shooting one litre (i.e. 1kg) of water into the ether is stratospherically expensive - with prices starting at around $1700 per kg.
The good news it that there is a “significant amount” of water on the moon, and while some small-time thinkers claim that its best use would be to turn it into hydrogen and use the Moon as a fuelling station for Mars trips, I’m fairly sure that a quick poll of humanity would reveal that MOON BEER would be the preferred option.
Until then, NASA is ready, and has thoroughly investigated growing wheat in space, as this research paper documents in mind-numbing detail. It appears that wheat - and in fact, any plant - can theoretically be transported and grown in low or zero-gravity conditions with very few problems worth space-phoning home about.
NASA has even grown wheat in the micro-gravity of the International Space Station, and it looks like… normal wheat.

So will we need to wait long until we have BEER IN SPACE?
That’s a big yes-with-a-but or a no-with-an-if.
Yes - it’ll take ages, because we either need to fire  cans of lager into space, or water to brew it up there - and it’s just so staggering expensive. As every hardened drinker knows, you get more drunken value for money with strong potables like whiskey.
And the "no" alternative? Here's where MONTAG’s favourite Human Wildcard appears. Yes, it’s Elon Musk, and if there is one man who’d consider spending hundreds of thousands of dollars making beer in space happen, it’s the man who fired his own car towards Mars.
MONTAG feels conflicted about Elon: on one hand he furious tweets unwise things about cave-rescue heroes and initiates bewildering, unwinnable beefs with hip-hop artists, but on the other he’s making outlandish statements about wanting to die on Mars and that humans will assume the role of “house cats to advanced AI.”
However, he has an opportunity to unequivocally win over the whole of humanity in one fell swoop. And that opportunity is spelled B-E-E-R-I-N-S-P-A-C-E. Make it so, Elon.

As music streaming has quickly become ubiquitous, and more readily connected to  our iPhones and Sonos speakers than ever, we're relying on AI to suggest new music for us to listen to. Joe Sparrow asks if we're actually hoping for something more...

Cast the first stone
Music is different to other artforms. It can run in parallel to other activities. You can listen to music whilst doing other things - working, running, idly plucking at nasal hair - and still enjoy it to the fullest extent.
You might be re-grouting the bathroom, yet your heart can still soar at a piece of music while you’re doing it. Now, try appreciating a Tracy Emin installation on your hands and knees in the shower. Music is just different like that.
And you don't need to explain musical favourites: they just are. You should never need to explain why, to pick an example entirely at random, the debut LP by mid-90s cagoule-wearing Britpop also-rans Cast is your go-to hungover-on-a-Saturday-morning album, even though you find yourself repeatedly doing exactly that.




Harder Better Faster Stronger
So if we have firm favourites, why do we need to discover new music? Because we’re dumb, restless humans who can never get enough of anything. Also, how did you find that favourite in the first place, smart-arse?
In the past it was simple: pick a radio show, listen every day, and buy the songs you like the most. Or get a recommendation from a trusted friend: the gold standard of recommendations, almost guaranteeing a listen.



Today it’s more complicated. More and more often, we find new music when your streaming service of choice nudges us towards new songs and artists. We're happily allowing machine learning to introduce new art into our lives. And it's frankly very good at it. But what if it's not what we really want?

99 Problems?
The myriad music discovery systems are all essentially there to solve the single problem of finding the unknown-unknowns. When we say something like “I want to hear something new,” what we’re actually saying is: “I want to hear something that I will definitely like that I don’t yet know I like, or expect, or know already.” It’s a big ask.
For instance: how readily will you commit to a song like The Killing Moon - the “greatest song ever written” according to the humble Ian McCulloch, the man who wrote it - if you don’t know anything about 80s UK rock music, let alone the absurdist mystique and legend that swirls about Echo and the Bunnymen like bong-smoke?



Incidentally, Ian McCulloch is right - it is the best song - but you need to arrive at that conclusion yourself. It’s this cavernous gap between opinion and fact that music-suggestion tech hopes to solve.

The vital connection is made
Music discovery is a bit different to discovering other art in other media. TV shows can be suggested on a like-for-like basis: enjoyed Game Of Thrones? Here’s another quasi-historic guts-’n'-mud TV show with dragons you can use to while away another 100 hours of your life.
One can hop between movies on the strength of a star, or books on the strength of the author. But music seems to resist simple “if you like that, you’ll like this” suggestions. Maybe it’s because pop music jiggles to life nebulous feelings as much as simply reproducing a catchy tune. Half the art of recording music is to capture lightning in a bottle: pop music is about inducing powerful emotions at will with each repeat-play.



And because big, deep emotions are at stirred, the barrier of entry is high. How do you let a new song into your heart when there are just so many of them? In the world of pop, scepticism is high, and tolerance is low. There’s a reason  the best pop songs reach the chorus in the first 30 seconds - we just won’t wait any longer.
Automated music discovery systems tend to take one of two approaches: trust the wisdom of the crowd, or attempt to know you better than you know yourself.
Services that take the former approach - like The Hype Machine or Last.fm - gauge what others are listening to and suggest what you might want. They work well because there’s a tacit understanding that this method of discovery has a low hit-rate: users expect misses as well as discovering new songs they love. But that means there are built-in limitations to this approach too: most people just want the hits.
The latter system - aiming to know our own music taste better than we do - is aimed at this bigger, trickier audience. And these systems can be eerily accurate when it comes to picking the next song for you. It’s because their tendrils, analysing you and your music taste, extend further than you’d expect - into music and your listening behaviour.

Spotify’s Discover Weekly, launched in 2015, is notable both for how on-point its recommendations are and for the feeling that it has somehow figured you out, pulling songs that you’d forgotten you love from the crevices of your memory. Here's how that magic process was explained to Hackernoon:

”To create Discover Weekly, there are three main types of recommendation models that Spotify employs:
• Collaborative Filtering models (i.e. the ones that Last.fm originally used), which work by analyzing your behavior and others’ behavior.
• Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, which work by analyzing text
• Audio models, which work by analyzing the raw audio tracks themselves.”

It sounds (and is) complex, but Spotify uses a few simple ideas (which result in complex code, eye-watering algorithms and some mind-boggling shuffling of datasets) to spew out personalised recommendations.
Recently, Spotify launched Your Time Capsule - with the vague tagline “a personalised playlist to take you back in time.” Stirring nostalgia - that most human of emotions - is a scientifically-proven smart move: the songs we liked in the past have a much stronger emotional pull over us than equivalently "good" songs from today.
I found that it pulled together a pretty good “personal best-of” playlist based on songs I like, but not anchored at a particular point in my life. On the other hand, friends told me how weird it felt to be dragged back to a time and place by those eerie algorithmic fingers.
Consider too, one of today's subtlest and most effective forms of recommendation: autoplay, when the music silently clicks over from something you chose to something you didn’t. How many times have suddenly realised that the last hour’s music was not picked by you? Was it when a great, new, song was played?
And there's more to come: Google Music says it uses computational AI to fine-tune its recommendations based on all that delicious data they have gathered on you over the years. Searching the web for "music suggestions" reveals a glut of different approaches, all with varying degrees of success.
Of course, one big reason that streaming platforms want you to listen more is because they want you to keep subscribing to the service (and it’s effective - back in 2015, Discover Weekly created 1.7 billion streams in under six months.)
It feels like the tech giants at least have almost got this licked, so far as they are using their bespoke algorithms to create slightly different flavours of recommendation sausage. So what if we want something else to eat?

Radio Head



Or maybe in an era of automated-this and algorithmic-that, we’ve come full-circle. Two years ago Apple Music launched - improbably - a radio station, Beats 1, which they claim is now “the biggest in the world”. In this model of music discovery, humans -  expensive, narrow-band algorithms with interesting voices - are important again.
And it works: Beats 1 is pretty good, although who knows how many people actually listen to “It’s Electric! - a weekly window into the mind of Metallica’s Lars Ulrich.”
Amid all this is the odd resurgence of vinyl, a very tangible form of music discovery in an ephemeral age. And while the vinyl sales charts suggest the vinyl-buying demographic is your dad, it’s equally likely that vinyl is a useful form of discovery, as long as the records being discovered are the same ones their parents used to play.
Both of these throwbacks suggest that, amidst the waves of auto-suggestion, listeners are hankering after something a bit more... human.
And why not - you don't wonder if your Discover Weekly playlist is flirting with you when it suggests you should listen to the 12" Club Mix of Take Me I'm Yours, but you might if Steve from HR did.

Maybe today, that “trusted friend” is anyone and everyone, just like how everyone is your friend and/or enemy online, tantalisingly within kissing/punching distance.
On one hand, we are all “musical discovery influencers” now: on a server farm somewhere, my data is meshing with yours and creating baby playlists which will open someone's eyes to music they never knew would move their soul (or introducing an unfathomable amount of late-90s UK garage hits to their playlist.)
And yet it feels like something real is missing too.
If music really is a different type of art, perhaps that introductory moment needs anchoring differently too. There's a balance to be struck between AI and DJ. Meanwhile, game the system and get the best of both worlds: re-purpose a sultry playlist as one of your own and send it to your office crush. Or Steve from HR.

Ruya worked on the stock market. She monitored trading. In her previous job, she worked in a warehouse, where she monitored inventory levels of household goods like toilet rolls and velcro.
The work was the same, and so was the pay: she took home the same B35,000 as everyone else who supervised Fully Automated processes.
At her desk, Ruya slowly rolled a ball made of jade in her left hand. She focussed vaguely on green numbers streaming upwards on one screen, and a green bar chart that scrolled from right to left on another. Like a trumpeter who mastered circular breathing, she felt like she could now observe what was happening in two directions at once, if she really zoned out: one screen per eye.
———
On the screens, numbers went up, up, up… then numbers went down, down, down. Then they went up, up, up again.
———
Ruya monitored automated trading of beans: lima, soy, and pinto. A few years after Full Automation was brought to the irrigation, solar capture and harvest distribution processes, the bean system finally hit 95% efficiency. By 2043, even variations in weather didn’t really affect the numbers any more.
Beans appeared, were harvested, moved, and were sold, all automatically. People didn’t really get involved so much. And Ruya watched over to make sure it all worked out OK. It always did.
The ebb and flow was a long, lazy sine wave. Occasionally Ruya felt that her heartbeat synchronised with a deep underlying pattern in the data stream. She couldn’t quite put her finger on what it was, but she sensed it nonetheless. Watching the data made Ruya feel light, serene, quietly alive.
———
Occasionally the bars and numbers would flicker red, signifying losses, dips and scrambled sell-offs by the system. Ruya didn’t flinch: the system took care of it instantaneously, and the green numbers and bars returned before she had even really processed the existence of red ones.
———
Behind the screens was a large glass window-wall, and just beyond the window-wall was a large maple tree. Its leaves were so apple-green they seemed to beam oxygen and freshness directly into her visual cortex, acid-washing it clean as the colour sluiced through.
Subtly, precisely, silently, the tree’s leaves and branchlets heaved up, up, up… then the branchlets returned down, down, down. Then they went up, up, up again.
Ruya observed the tree with the same slow gaze as she did the numbers: observing both tree and data simultaneously, with a placid nothingness/everythingness.
——-
When people asked, Ruya compared her work to that of pilots from the old days of commercial flight: mostly the computer took care of things, but she was there to step in, just in case.
The truth was that in the decade since Full Automation swept through the service, organisational, transport and manufacturing industries, she had only needed to step in once. That was back in the warehouse, when a fogged-up OCR reader had misread an order and automatically delivered 1,000 pigs to the warehouse instead of 1,000 pins.
This was a tricky mistake to resolve, but no-one got mad. In fact, this particular instance of human error - where the human had not designed a delivery bay to reject unwieldily quantities of pigs - was now sometimes used as a case-study in certain Full Automation university classes.
———
Returning her thoughts to the maple tree, it struck Ruya that, if you ignored the irregular movements caused by the breeze, the whole tree seemed to be inflating and deflating. A smooth, grand, woozy rhythm that filled her field of vision. Leaves, numbers and charts.
Ruya brought her thoughts to Biscuit, her childhood dog, and how he would sleep on her pillow, his ribcage softly rising and falling in time with his faint snores.
———
Back in the early days of her monitoring work Ruya was dizzy with the realisation that she was getting paid to do nothing, and she played games to pass the time in the factory.
First, she played Soltaire, both on the spare monitor and then, hankering after tangibility, with old-fashioned cards. Then, seeking more excitement, she played Minecraft 2.0 - the version where killing got more important than building stuff, and then Fortnite 4 - the version where building stuff got more important than the killing.
But eventually she stopped playing games. It wasn’t that she ran out of new games she wanted to play. It was right around the same time she realised she was completely wrong about being paid to do nothing.
It was important work. She was getting paid to do everything, to be part of everything, to feel everything. The whole world was in sync. Ruya saw it all, absorbed it all, and let it happen.

Today, it's hard to imagine picking up a phone and messaging someone without embellishing the words - or replacing them entirely - with emoji. Emoji is so engrained in our culture that it's a shock to remember that until very recently, not all devices were even able to properly display them.
Today, emoji are so fundamental to communication that, as MONTAG's Kathryn Lawrence asks, can we now consider it a language on its own?

📖 No short history of emoji would be complete without mentioning its origin in Japan in the late 90s.
The word emoji shares only a coincidental similarity with “emotion” (which has its Latin root in “movement”); “emoji” comes from Japanese (e = picture, moji = character). The Unicode Consortium are the “shadowy overlords” of emoji, deciding which picture characters will be included in the universal language of Unicode, which allows for the translation of text characters across operating systems and displays.
And they are in charge of a particularly diverse and nuanced set of characters. The original set of 176 symbols has now expanded to include as many as 1,851 emojis, according to Emojipedia, including different flesh tones ordered by the Fitzpatrick scale.


The Emojipedia

There are too many clichés about language that one could apply to an analysis of the humble emoji: do they really speak louder than words, as numerous headlines have asserted? Is a 12 pixel by 12 pixel picture equal to a thousand words? What can an analysis of the usage of this pictorial “secret language” tell us about the state of online discourse?
Mark Davis, the president of the Unicode Consortium, says we shouldn't call it a language, and linguists classify text-based emoticons, such as colon-hyphen-close parenthesis or :-), and emoji, as “discourse particles” when they are used to convey tone.

💬 But the use of emoji as its own pictorial language similar to hieroglyphics is undeniable.


Emoji Dick

One of the most notable examples of emoji “translation” is  Fred Benenson’s emoji adaptation of Moby Dick. In 2015, the Oxford Dictionary named “😂” (Laughing Crying, also known as Face With Tears Of Joy) its word of the year.
This emoji also happens to be the most popular, according to a 2017 study which ranked emoji use globally and found some interesting cultural differences in the results. As courtship increasingly takes place online over instant messages, another study has noted the emojis that elicit the most positive responses from men and women.



As an April Fools prank this year, Duolingo announced they would provide a course in emoji as a second language, but with new emoji coming out every year, it may actually be a necessary service for the unhip to be able to communicate. 2017’s new emojis to be released in Unicode 10 are already up on Emojipedia, but users who don’t have the latest operating systems will most likely see only empty squares.

👀 One of the arguments against counting emoji as a language is that they look different to everyone.


Face Screaming In Fear emoji via Mentalfloss

It’s up to the designers at Apple, Google, and other manufacturers to decide how they want their interpretation of the Unicode to display, which sometimes produces bizarre differences in the same emoji, which lead to differing interpretations of sentiment.
Hypebeast makes the case for emoji as the modern Rosetta stone, and its use in combination with those other internet-specific semiotic markers, memes, make a strong case for emoji as a universal language (although one writer has also argued that memes are a form of “semiotic anarchism.”
Let’s take the frog emoji as an example for semiotic analysis to see how its multiple meanings have been shaped by several divergent strands of online discourse.
Frog Face (🐸) is an icon, when used by amphibian enthusiasts: as a representation of an actual frog.
However, a lone Frog Face now carries a more insidious meaning in online discourse. Pepe the Frog, Matt Furie’s internet-famous cartoon character has been co-opted as a symbol of the American alt-right, a white nationalist group, and the Frog Face emoji now indexes as a reference to Pepe (as confirmed by Emojipedia).
The cartoon’s association with the political movement (and its subsequent pseudo-religious symbolism) has not only caused the cartoon character to be classified as a symbol of hate speech but also ruined a perfectly good animal emoji – if Frog Face is to be used innocuously, it must be accompanied by another discourse particle.
Frog Face followed by Hot Beverage (🐸☕️) is used to refer to the meme known as “But That’s None Of My Business” symbolised by Kermit the Frog drinking tea:


Kermit drinking tea via Meme Generator

Comprehension of this meme and emoji combination also relies on the use of “tea” as synonymous with gossip. In opposition to Pepe the Frog, Kermit has also become a memetic icon, symbolizing rational thought and often, self-reflection (as in the Evil Kermit meme. 
Although the citation is needed, Wikipedia’s entry for Kermit under “Frogs in Culture,” rings true:
“Kermit the Frog, on the other hand, is a conscientious and disciplined character of Sesame Street and The Muppet Show; while openly friendly and greatly talented, he is often portrayed as cringing at the fanciful behaviour of more flamboyant characters.”
Although the gist of the “But That’s None Of My Business” meme is that Kermit (and the user, as they identify themselves with the frog through use of the meme) is stirring up trouble with salacious gossip, they are also exhibiting self-restraint, and respecting social order. Whereas Pepe’s “feels good, man,” slogan, and whatever words of hate speech are put into the character’s mouth by the alt-right’s “meme armies”, defies social convention in favor of self-indulgence and shock value.

⚠️ The cyber-ethno-herpetology of decoding frog symbols in internet culture clearly shows that frogs portray a spectrum that encompasses the full range of human emotions.
From Pepe’s transformation from feels good stoner frog to symbol of hatred; to the humanity and relatability of sad Kermit, and the absurdist elation that gripped the internet at the peak of “Dat Boi” mania (o shit waddup!)

We experience life through a series of windows: whether it's a magazine, TV or phone, they all frame our reality in one way or another. Soon it'll be time to fling the window open, peer through and take in a more perfect reality – one that's designed just for you.

Are you a Nomophobe? If you’ve ever experienced the sudden pang of anxiety when you realise your phone is dead, that you’re isolated from your virtual network, and oh-god-what-do-I-do-now, then you’ve already joined that particular club.
And while you’re nervously rummaging in your pockets for a portable phone charger (and oh-god-what-if-that’s-dead-too), take a moment to imagine a future where you’re not tied to a phone - and where any place or object can be your screen, your messaging app, or your browser.
Or more: so much more.

There’s a huge leap in perception when a quick peek into another world fills your field of vision: your brain suddenly thinks, hey — I’m there.

Interacting with the world through small screens is second nature: a Snapchat sent from the other side of the globe is a glimpse of life somewhere else. But there’s a huge leap in perception when that quick peek fills your field of vision: your brain suddenly thinks, hey — I’m there.
Some deceptively big philosophical questions loom large here. If everything that you see only truly exists inside your eyes: at what point does “virtual reality” simply become “reality?” This is the story of where our visual reality is going, and why it’ll feel so real when you get there.
But let’s rewind a bit. This is a future that starts right now, via consumer-ready VR devices that remodel how you look at the world, and how you interact with it.
And the big stuff is nowhere nearly as far away as you think.

TODAY: The screen is your window
By now you’ve possibly — at the behest of an excited friend—slipped your phone into a Cardboard “VR” headset, and felt the quick-and-dirty thrill of a 360º animation. (It was probably one of the rollercoaster ones. Everyone loves the rollercoaster ones. Wheeeee!)
The modern VR revolution started with simplicity, for good reason. By virtually replicating experiences we’re already used to—video games, linear videos, simple human interaction, (rollercoasters!) — VR firms are betting that we’ll willingly swallow the gateway drug. We’re stepping into a future most of us can’t even picture yet.
The excitement of these very basic VR experiences, whilst real, is brief. Once the novelty wears off, what remains is a passive experience, pixellated graphics, and a surge of nausea—a non-virtual experience reminiscent of green-gilled car journeys.
But an interactive, non-vomitous leap between realities is where the future really begins. Moore’s law has held fast, and we’ve whooshed past the VR tipping point, where the visual processing needed to convince to our highly attuned sense of space met the miniaturised tech needed to make it plausible.

You can fast-track the growth of your laundry pile with a succession of soiled trousers by playing Resident Evil 7 in VR

That’s why it’s impossible to avoid the miasma of hype around Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PS VR. These products are anything but gimmicks: they’re powerful gateways to virtual worlds where. Once inside, and having performed backflips, your brain will rush off in ten directions at once as it gets to grips with the new possibilities a hyper-unreal world delivers.
And while you can fast-track the growth of your laundry pile with a succession of soiled trousers by playing Resident Evil 7 in PS VR, it’s applications like Google’s Tilt Brush that will literally change your perspective as, for the first time, you can paint in three dimensions, and view the subsequent drawing from any angle or point in time you desire.
But transforming how something as fundamental as drawing is made, understood and experienced is only scratching the surface. The next wave of virtual reality technology isn’t merely aiming to create worlds: it wants to utterly change the one you already know.

TOMORROW: The window is your (magic) window
The stunning strength of VR is also its stumbling block: users, absorbed in the “other place,” can’t interact with the place they’re standing in. The screen is literally a barrier between the user and the real world — great for immersion; not so good for integration.
What happens when the real world is mixed with the virtual? This is where things get interesting. In Augmented, or Mixed Reality, you’ll look through a transparent screen and anything you like can be superimposed over, or woven into, your world.
So if VR is impressive and immersive, AR can be all the other -ives too: intuitive, unobtrusive, additive, even subversive.
Wait - isn’t this Google Glass on steroids? Nope — this is a hyper-augmented reality where the headset understands the shape of the world around you and places virtual objects into it, seamlessly. Microsoft’s Hololens, only slightly bulkier than Oculus, has already slipped into the gap between our eyes and what we used to call reality.

So what will AR feel like? Well, magic.

So what will AR feel like? Well, magic. Think past games and designed experiences - and look to your phone for inspiration (how’s that battery % now?) Now, notifications become choices, not annoyances; and information intuitively arrives when you need it.
Glance up to the sky to see a cluster of notifications dangling above you. Dismiss them with a blink or let your gaze hang on one to open it up, and then swipe it away with your hand when you realise it’s an email from LinkedIn.
Later: it’s been a long day—and you fancy watching a movie on a big screen, but your apartment is the size of a cupboard. So open Netflix, select The Shining, and with a pinch of thumb and forefinger, re-size and pin the movie onto the farthest wall. Squeamish? Turn away while Jack’s on the rampage, and the movie will hang on the far wall where you left it.
Maybe any object can become an interactive tool: pick up a rectangular object —a book, a menu, or, hey, even a phone that’s out of juice— and your AR device will superimpose a “tablet” interface on it. It’ll track the object and your hands so you can swipe, taps and pinch as normal while you browse Buzzfeed (and yes, gifs will flourish like graffiti in your new augmented world.)
It’ll initially feel like magic – and then,  it’ll quickly be part of life. And these are the simplest examples.
Now picture the day when Kim Kardashian sashays into your living room and sits down next to you…

SOON: there is no window
In the end we won’t need screens at all.  Magic Leap is the wealthiest startup you’ve never heard of, and may change your life in ways you can’t even conceive. The company is as dazzlingly ambitious as it is utterly secretive— but maybe the latter is necessary when you’re building a headset that’ll beam a new reality directly into your eyeballs.
This technology — a virtual retinal display — means that there’s no screen at all; and because images are projected via fibre optic cables directly onto your retina, the imagery isn’t “high-resolution” - it’s the same resolution as your eyes.
Couple this realism with advanced 3D modelling techniques, an understanding of the world around you and how objects fit into it, and your world can be populated with virtual objects.
Welcome to IRL 2.0, where the world is exactly shaped to your bidding. Tired and emotional after a late night out, and lost on your way home? Street signs can now flash to catch your attention and point you home and to your bed. Bored of adverts that clutter a walk down the high street? How about a real-world ad-blocker that replaces billboards with Beyoncé gifs?

Why watch the Kardashians on TV if you could summon a 3D-Kim to sit in the chair next to you?

If this all sounds too far-fetched to be real, then the likes of Google, Alibaba and others didn’t get the memo, because they’ve have poured billions of dollars into projects to make this happen. So what will a truly augmented reality be like? And what happens when you can’t see the join between the two realities?
The logical endpoint for a barrier-less mixed reality is a semi-fantasy world where, put simply, we get what we want. It’s kind of already been here for a while: we have already blurred boundaries between our world and the scripted “reality” of Reality TV.
So why watch the Kardashians on TV if you could summon a 3D Kim to sit in the chair next to you, and spill the beans, face to flawlessly-made-up-face? Tell me everything, Kim.
Twist the dial, blur the lines further: if you could recreate a dead pet into a 3D avatar that faithfully followed you all day, would you? What about dead family members? Or ex-lovers? Could you resist?
Our mixed reality is almost here. And when it arrives, it’ll reveal the single greatest frustration you’ll ever feel: next, you’ll want to reach out and touch what you see.

Professor Adam Alter is a psychologist. He specialises in investigating how people spend their time and how they are affected by technology’s emotionless/relentless grip on our time, attention, and minds. He made three discoveries, each more interesting than the last.   The first is that we’re hooked on screens: since the introduction of the iPhone, we have started to use up almost all of our free time looking at glowing screens and tapping things on them. And statistically, the less time you spend interacting with a screen, the happier you get.   The second thing he learnt is that we use screens for stuff that make us happy (like exercise, reading, or educational apps) three times less than things that are proven to make us less happy (gaming, news, dating and social media apps, etc.) The latter apps play directly to our fears of FOMO, loneliness, and social inadequacy and they don’t tell us to stop using them. And we’re really bad at stopping using them.  The third thing he found out was that the people who make the tech that we’re addicted to and makes us unhappy already know the first two things and thus “don't use their own products.”
Silicon Valley high-flyer Athena Chavarria, who works at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, puts it more hysterically: “I am convinced the devil lives in our phones and is wreaking havoc on our children.” Fun Fact: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is the philanthropic project of Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. Facebook owns Instagram. Users spend, on average, 53 minutes a day on the Android Instagram app.Silicon Valley might care about its darling offspring, but it doesn’t seem to give a hoot about us, the dumbo drones who poke mindlessly at our screens waiting for enlightenment as our happiness slowly draining away. At this point, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the outlook for us screen-addled humans is a bit grim. Tumblin’ Dice  Tristan Harris, Co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, describes our phones in a terrifying way: as “a slot machine… that several billion people have their pocket.” When we absent-mindedly refresh email, swipe on tinder or scroll on Instagram, we’re popping a coin in the slot and pulling the lever to see if three cherries pop up in a row.  It’s a compelling revelation and it fits with most people’s nervous-habit smartphone use. And while occasional gambling gives little bursts of happiness, consistent use almost always results in long-term unhappiness. Does that sound like any app you use?White Punks On Dope  Dopamine Labs was “a controversial California startup that promises to significantly increase the rate at which people use any running, diet or game app.”  Snapshots of the company’s old website from 2016 reveal that it offered products to “make your app habit-forming” which would help you “lock-in a habit user,” because “we’re literally an API for Dopamine… Hooking your users.”Only you, dear reader, can judge how language like “habit-forming,” “lock-in a user,” and “hooking your users” makes you feel, but either way, gird your loins for the Pivot To End All Pivots: Dopamine Labs is now called Boundless Mind, a company that is “helping change human behavior for the better” by learning how people’s minds work -  and then giving users the “reward” they want.  Boundless Mind’s site is splashed with eyebrow-raising concepts like Behavioural Engineering, which promises that “THE BRAIN IS PROGRAMMABLE… Predictably change your users' behaviour using real-time Persuasive AI Engines.” Presumably it’s the technology and the intent behind it which is different to that of Dopamine Labs’, and not merely the wording of the sales pitch.   But the clear takeaway is that there’s gold in them thar thrills, and app makers are willing to pay big bucks to a company that can “change the… behaviors, beliefs, and being” of it’s users and keep ‘em hooked on their screens.  That said, Ramsey Brown, co-founder of Boundless Mind, is altruistic in his ambitions, and acknowledges that people feel icky about things like, erm, mind control. He’s at pains to point out the positive use of his tech: “What if we sell you those mind-control tools to help people get off opioids? Or to communicate with each other on a more meaningful level?”  And surely we can all agree on that.  He also says that the company has turned down opportunities to work with gambling companies and freemium game apps, who wanted to train their users to use their apps (and, presumably, spend) more. While this is extremely admirable, it does also kind-of make his company the arbiter of which technology does and does not intend to secretly make us chemically addicted to it.  At this point you might want to ask yourself: who knows best what will make me happy - me, the person who’s locked in here with my brain, or a company that wants to make money out of my subconscious actions? Do I want to allow myself to be manipulated by a learning AI that knows how to make me do things before even I know that I want to do them?   These, friends, are reasonable questions. That GuyIt’s possible, of course, to exist in 2018 while barely touching or looking at a screen. We all know That One Guy who insists on using a dumbphone and to whom you need to relay, via SMS, the details of a get-together that has been painstakingly arranged via WhatsApp with everyone else. So has That Guy got it right all along?  Short answer: yes. Long answer: probably, yes.  So what should we do about all this? Screens are making us unhappy, and the apps on them are making us addicted to screens. Whoops! Reducing your screen time is a good and stupefyingly obvious place to start: the simplest route to freeing up the mental space you hadn’t realised you’d lost.  MONTAG’s Hot Tips For Resisting Screen Temptation: Oscar Wilde said “I can resist everything except temptation,” and it applies to all of us: we can’t drag ourselves away from the apps on our phones. It’s almost as if they have been designed to keep us psychologically addicted! Here’s MONTAG’s hot-hot-hot guide to putting the phone down and reclaiming your life: 1) When you get home from work/the pub/the whatever, immediately put your phone on silent mode. 2) Put the phone in a drawer of a cupboard so the screen can’t beckon you, siren-like, to its colourful morass of notifications. 3) Put the cupboard into a space rocket. 4) Stand back a safe distance. 5) Fire the rocket directly into the moon. 6) Relax, open a book or knit, or do woodwork, or whatever, and luxuriate in the weird… soothing… ancient… calm that almost instantly floods your life when you’re not constantly on edge, waiting to tap a colourful square on a small screen. 7) Buy a dumbphone and get used to telling friends that the reason you weren’t at that party last weekend was because you didn’t see it on Facebook.  If this plan seems a little complex or expensive, feel free to skip points #3, 4, 5 and 7 - but be aware that, on your death bed, you *will* fully regret not going the whole hog. Screen If You Want To Go Faster  There are other ways to avoid screens. Some are about embracing lo-fi tech to combat the rectangular menace. MONTAG has marvelled before at the IRL Glasses, specially polarised sunglasses modelled on those in classic Sci-Fi flick They Live  which instantly block all screens… except your phone. Hmm.  Alternatively, you can stop yourself being tempted to look at your pocket-screen in the first place. Clothing from Unpocket’s “1984 collection” contains a Faraday Cage in the form of a “stealth pocket made from police-grade shielding fabrics that securely block all Cell, WiFi, GPS and RFID signals” - into which you can pop your phone, safe in the knowledge that nothing will cause it to chirrup due to a notification.  Better still, why not remove yourself from the problem entirely? “Tech-free safaris” in South Africa are priced at $1000 a day, and promise utter luxury without a screen in sight. It’s eye-wateringly expensive and MONTAG’s intergalactic approach might be more cost effective: a swift calculation reveals that, if the cost of firing 1Kg of matter into space via Space X’s Falcon 9 rocket costs $4640, then to pop your 174g iPhone X aboard would cost a piffling $807.36 - less that one night on a tech-free safari, and a thousand times more satisfying, not to say explosive.   The above do feel like extreme responses (some more so than others). Real progress might lie in something rather prosaic, and a thousand times harder: using deliberate self-control to quietly, effectively brings back the happiness that has been nullified by screens. The dreadful truth is that training yourself to mindfully put down the phone or look away from the screen and to engage with books, friends and hobbies is the only real way to bring the happiness back that screens have sapped. But it will.And there’s one other really important reason to start tearing your eyes away from the addictive rectangles. Boundless Mind’s mind-hooking tech is now ready to be used in VR and AR technology to make sure that the things users see floating in front of them is “what they want.” Facebook is one of the major players in VR/AR. If Facebook could seamlessly and “predictably change your behaviour” using AR content right in front of your eyeballs, what do you guess they would do with that power? And would it really make you happier? How would you know?   Now please, close this browser window and go read a book. But you won’t, will you…

A viable alternative?
MONTAG has previously grasped at straws and tried to explain why not understanding what cyptocurrencies like Bitcoin do is the most important part of engaging with cryptocurrencies.
Reminder: just jump on board and enjoy the wild ride!
But there are always people who want to get more involved: like the people who want their own cryptocurrency. And just like how turning over your trust to the system is what makes cryptocurrencies work, allowing people to make their own currencies is evidence that they are a powerful manifestation of tomorrow’s commerce.
So we shouldn’t automatically laugh at all of these weirdo currencies - just the majority of them.
Because there are actually an array of very specific coins that may prove to be incredibly useful to certain industries or communities, like AudioCoin, with whom Bjork has dallied, and rewards investment in music with AudioCoins.
This is a kind of fascinating precident: in the future artist-specific coins may appear. It makes a lot of sense, in music communities that are, in their very essence, fanatical, and look to grow themselves. What better way to wrap yourself up in an a #fandom by buying their coins, and watching your investment grow as the community grows?
via GIPHY
Other coins, like the extremely-80s-sci-fi-movie-monikered ArtByte, are essentially Bitcoins For Art, allowing you to support the artist of your choice by investing ArtBytes in them.
As for the question of why not simply invest your fiat currency of choice in these artists, I refer you to the general rule of cryptocurrency: stop asking questions, and drink the Kool-Aid. The glorious future will follow regardless.

It’s possible that this inherent hopefulness is what has lead to the glut of altcoins; it’s also possibly why many of those same altcoins are dying amusing or saddening deaths. Reminder: crypto is hard.
Most of these coins are ludicrous - but within them all is a real, important concept: now, anyone can change the world using something previously only available to governments and banks: currency. And they can do it in a way that is is truly meaningful, powerful, and disruptive to its community.  It’s just that most of them choose not to do that.
So while you read about these, the oddest altcoins, remember that this is what tomorrow’s world of decentralised business looks like. If you want to picture the future, imagine a Potatocoin stamping on a human face, forever.

ALTCOINS BASED, INEXPLICABLY, ON PEOPLE
TRUMP (TrumpCoin)
Trumpcoin, whose website manages to - either deliberately or by design - capture that corporate-internet-circa-2001 aesthetic that seems to follow Trump around, was created because the community behind TrumpCoin "would like to further assist President Trump in accomplishing his goals.”
Goal number one was revealed, with a little ceremony, to be TrumpCoin Cause Fund #1, the aim of which was to,

“Contribute to the southern border security project between the United States and Mexico.”

TrumpCoin enthusiasts were, erm, unenthusiastic, with the first reply to the announcement posted by a palpably hurt TrumpCoin administrator: “Looking for any and all feedback.”
As of now, you can still contribute to the TrumpCoin Cause, but you can also pay via Paypal, which sort of undermines the whole project somewhat.

PRES (President Trump Coin)
Astonishingly - or entirely predictably in the altcoin-universe - there are two competing President Trump-flavoured altcoins, although PRES coin has experienced a fall from grace even greater than The Donald’s approval rating.
PRES’s price tumbled from an all-time high of 3.7¢ on the day Trump was sworn in to a dispiriting 0.4¢ today.
Still, much like the voters of Our Most Orange Leader, this coin's enthusiasts live in certain knowledge that they have absolutely not wasted their time and they will definitely MAGA just as soon as things inevitably turn the corner. Look out Kim Jong-Il Coin!

The story of Coinye is the microcosmic story of many altcoins: wild promise mixed with hurr-hurr jokery, followed by brief highs, bottomless lows and bitter recrimination.

COINYE (Coinye West)
If you were in any doubt as to the bubblicious allure of the altcoin, it turns out all you need is a weak pun to get one off the ground and taken seriously. And what better metaphor for something that’s over-hyped, flashy and partway between unhinged genius and emperor’s-new-clothes ridiculousness than Kayne West?
Behold Coinye West, the altcoin that “paid homage” to the famously humourless rapper, and whose glorious time being traded was cut short in true Kayne fashion, when he, “sued Coinye into oblivion.”
The Coinye founders’ lawyer said that it was, “unfortunate that a parody turned into such an expensive endeavor," and that he, "views the whole process as a learning experience,” to which the correct response is of course, a face-palm.

DOGE (Dogecoin)
Dogecoin is a coin that has managed to coast further on its memetic roots than most. It’s the altcoin that says, “If you fondly remember Doge, 2013’s ‘Meme Of The Year’, then here’s the investment opportunity you have been waiting for!”
While Dogecoin is ostensibly a tempting cryptocurrency and can theoretically be used for any useful purchase or investment - including, in 2014, raising money to dig a well in Kenya - actual uses of the coin seem to be limited to The LULZ.
Two of the more successful uses of Dogecoin were to mint an actual Dogecoin and land it on the moon (a trip that has sadly been delayed until 2019), sending the Jamaican Bobsleigh Team to the 2014 Winter Olympics, and funding a NASCAR entry to compete at the Talladega Superspeedway (driver Josh Wise finished 20th).
Surprise! All those LOLS ended up pivoting to a whole pile of OMFGs, as a series of alleged bugs, alleged shady dealings, and alleged real-world bankruptcies sent Dogecoin’s value down the toilet. Wow. Much sadness. Such devaluation.
Still, Dogecoin is too cute to die and a hardcore of enthusiasts are showing puppyish enthusiasm and working hard to keep their favourite pet alive a bit longer. Dogecoin’s value is starting to rise again, so fans of well-worn animal memes could soon be crowdfunding more hilarious/tiresome ventures.

NYAN (Nyancoin)
By now you should have got the picture: take a meme, an enthusiastic set of coders looking to make a swift buck whilst having some very specific deep-corner-of-the-internet laughs – and you’ve got yourself a viable cryptocurrency.
As we’ve already learnt, altcoins seem to be the money version of the Peter Principle, insomuch as the prospects of any altcoin can theoretically rise to wild success, but generally only reach the level of its own incompetence.
As numerous crash ’n’ burn bitcoin stories pile up around our feet, we could be forgiven for thinking that Nyancoin, an altcoin based around - sigh - a feline cartoon meme, with an identically-named competitor, etc. etc. - is destined for a very rainbow-coloured flame-out.
Except Nyancoin is ticking over very nicely, thanks very much: not creating a huge splash but not really doing anyone any harm, either. People are slowly but steadily trading Nyancoins for Bitcoins and Bitcoins for Nyancoins - and for what end, you might ask?
Well, who knows, but in a subculture full of failure, fraud and financial woe, it's very nice to see the cartoon currency happily pootle along.

SPUDS (Potatocoin)
The road to hell, apparently, is paved with good intentions. If so, maybe the developers of Potatocoin are slowly trudging along that particular straße, wondering what went wrong. Because Potatocoin - crazy name, crazy idea - had its heart in the right place.
Potatocoin had a mission, which was to help farmers in the developing world - by creating a currency that made transactions easy in areas that had no banks, no computers and no contracts. It would work via mobile phone, and would make life easier, better and happier.
The problem for the founders was twofold: they couldn’t win over an understandably sceptical crypto-community (in a world full of coin-scams the sample comment, “LOL, REALLY, HELP PEOPLE?” rings sadly true) and they quickly realised that the developing world was A Very Big Place With Lots Of People In It and they’d all need to have cryptocurrency explained to them.
It was too much. Potatocoin was mashed under the weight of its own expectations and ambitions, and by 2015, it had had its chips.


PIE (Pizzacoin)
I have been reading about Pizzacoin for half an hour now and have no idea if it is a very very niche in-joke by nerds, for nerds, or a real altcoin. Or both. It's safe to say the safest investment in something with the word "pizza" in the title should come hot, doughy, and with cheese on top.
Laugh it up, but all the people in the above photo posing with "the genesis pizza" have almost certainly lost more money trading altcoins than you and I will ever make.

TACO (TacoCoin)
Tacocoin: the "yeah, why not?" coin, set out with a noble (I guess? Who knows?) aim: to Change The Way The World Buys Tacos, because in the parallel reality of altcoin-startup-world, disrupting something that has worked perfectly well for millennia is absolutely accepted as normal.
Latest headlines on the Tacocoin subreddit reek of the same will-this-do? approach include "We just broke $68 market cap!", "I can't program or anything, but if the devs or mods need help I'm here," and "Tacocoin is not dead until the last taco is crumbled!"
Tacocoin is still with us, but is being treated with the irrelevance it unwittingly sought.

COIN-CLUSIONS
It's still easier to buy a taco with boring old coins. Trump's fantasy wall still isn't being built.
But don't miss the trick: altcoins point to a time when we can make money - the big, dumb, catch-all - work in very specific ways for very specific problems. Not quite yet, mind you - there's still a lot of niche LOLS left to be funded before we get round to solving things like poverty and hunger with an altcoin.

How do modern athletes consistently break records and surpass our expectations on the limits of human performance? Is it really mind over matter? Or all in the new sweat-wicking, heart-rate monitoring, muscle-compressing sleepwear? What are they feeding these people??In the 2018 Berlin marathon, Eliud Kipchoge broke the world record by undercutting the last record-holder's time by a full minute (which hasn't been done since 1969) – shaving off three seconds per mile on average for the entirety of the endurance race.Every year, competitors in professional sports strive to overcome their personal bests and end up beating the best recorded athletes in the world, while even experts in sports science are wondering how it's possible for humans to continually improve to such a degree. David Epstein, writer of The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance, gave a TED Talk in 2014 asking how it's possible that modern athletes regularly beat our expectations: "Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?" As is the case for most rhetorical questions asked in the titles of TED Talks, the answer is a little more complicated than a simple yes or no. Epstein says in his TED Talk that it isn't just new training technology that makes today's athletes so much better, stronger, and faster than their predecessors: it has a lot to do with the technology supporting the competitions like springy running tracks and guttered swimming pools, the development of new techniques, as well as the selection of different body types and DNA analysis, advances in sports science whose impacts have only been felt within the last century....but the new training technology also definitely helps. These high-tech innovations are redefining how athletes train past the limits of human performance.You can catch what you can't seeIn most sports that involve ball handling, it's important for the player not only to know where the ball is but where it's going to be. To help athletes acquire this psychic ability to see 0.5 seconds into the future, trainers are making it harder to see what's going on right in front of them.Goggles like these by Senaptec create a strobing effect that blacks out the wearer's vision in short bursts, forcing their brain to fill in the blanks.Training with strobing technology was been tested in ice hockey, leading to an 18% increase in performance, and could have beneficial effects for non-athletes as well, as it was shown in one study to improve short term memory. Another, slightly more low-tech model of occlusion goggles limits athletes' peripheral vision, forcing them to be more spatially aware and develop motor skills with less visual feedback, like these Chin Up Goggles, with the added bonus of looking very fly:The strobing goggles will cost you about $350 if you want to try to improve your catching or trivia game, and Chin Up ships worldwide for €17.79 – but opening and closing your own eyes is free.  Get your head in the gameIn 1997, Timothy Noakes and a team of researchers from the Sports Science Institute of South Africa re-ignited interest in a biological theory first proposed in 1924, called the Central Governor Theory. The theory of the central governor is that fatigue is not simply a by-product of muscle exertion, but a brain process designed to store energy for emergencies and protect the body from catastrophic muscle failures or injuries. If you've ever "hit a wall" in a workout, blame the central governor.  Noakes popularized the theory throughout the late 90s and early 2000s with the life hacking blogosphere and on podcasts like the Bulletproof Executive, before becoming involved in a high profile controversy about dietary recommendations which cost him his medical license. The theory itself sounds too good to be true: is it really the brain, and not the limits of the muscles, that keeps athletes from giving one hundred and ten percent? And by extension, could you hack your mind to trick your body into peak performance?Epstein references research testing the central governor theory in a discussion wtih two other experts in sports science for TED Ideas about what sports will look like in the future. In studies where athletes were given a placebo or amphetamines, they were found to be able to work through a core temperature of 104º F, where the body normally starts sending fatigue signals due to the risk of heat stroke.Of course, speeding on amphetamines is not recommended for any professional or non-professional athlete, but if these results could be replicated through the use of other psychological training methods or sheer willpower, it proves the governor can be overcome; as do the number of catastrophic muscle failures that have been seen at the end of record-breaking marathons, like Gabriela Andersen-Schiess's crippling heat stroke in the 1984 Summer Games:Take the pressure offA report by the Innovation Enterprise about how technology is changing contact sports references head-to-toe wearable tech developed by the biggest names in sports: Adidas, Reebok, UnderArmour, Nike, and even Gatorade with a wearable patch to measure hydration. If you move a single muscle on your body, it's guaranteed that someone has already developed wearable technology for you to track, optimize, and train that movement. Some professional athletes are complaining that wearable tech has already gone too far, as a lineman for the Canadian Football League complains, "I feel like a guinea pig sometimes when we talk about athletes and technology, and I stress that we’re people too." Athletes are under constant pressure, as every decision they make in their lives, from what they wear, what they eat, and how they sleep, can affect their game. The latest technologies are also designed to take some of the pressure off: the atmospheric pressure.The AlterG anti-gravity treadmill encases your lower body in a pressurized bubble to control how much of your body weight it carries. It has been applied in rehabilitation programs to lighten the load on people re-learning how to walk, and can be used in training through injuries. Conversely, adding atmospheric pressure to the body could train muscles to adapt to high pressure, so that running under normal atmospheric conditions now feels like walking on the moon.Training in an extreme scenario, like hypoxic training done in high altitudes, can adapt the body to perform under different types of pressure, so that performance under normal circumstances is a breeze. One of the innovations that Epstein predicts will become more common from professional athletes in the next decade is the opposite, hyperoxic training. "One thing I think we’ll see for sure within the next 10 years is more widespread use of hyperoxic training, which is people who are training with masks on to give them more than atmospheric oxygen, because it turns out that the body will work out much harder than you can normally. The oxygen mask that football players use between plays, when those have been tested versus placebo masks, they actually don’t work, because when you’re resting, there’s plenty of oxygen in the air around you. The problem is you can’t get it where it needs to go quickly enough in your body. But when you’re actually working out as hard as you can, and you’re an elite athlete, you can move your blood so fast that it doesn’t catch as much oxygen as it could. So if you’re working out with a mask on, that increases that oxygen pressure around you, and you can actually work out way harder than you would be able to normally. I think you’ll also see places like some of the countries that have sort of centralized sports science institutes build facilities that are hyperoxic conditions to allow athletes to train in them often."Breathing harder to get better, faster, and stronger in training is only one of the many ways athletes are using technology to surpass human limitations. Defying their mental limits and changing their perceptions through the aid of special goggles is only the tip of the iceberg. Although they stress "we're people too," in the future, athletes could be more machine than man.

Playing your PS4 Pro or Xbox One isn't just fun, but research has shown that regular play of a Mario game improves the brain's visual, navigation, and fine motor control abilities - and actually grows these areas of the brain.
It's up to you to decide which is more remarkable: the fact that video games are good for you, or that your brain can grow simply by doing fun tasks. But the idea of turbo-charging your mind's abilities is, as Kathryn Lawrence discovers, a tempting - and surprisingly achievable - ambition...

We all know this feeling: you already have so much to do, but you know you have the potential to do more, and while the tasks in front of you are absolutely doable, you just can't seem to get it all done.
Maybe it hits you at 3 PM at work, or the night before a big deadline, but no matter when it strikes, it's the most inconvenient time.
Most of us have found our own ways to cope with this feeling: healthy methods include taking a walk, doing some light stretching, or just relaxing until you can turn your mind back to the task you should be focused on.
Less healthy methods include beating your head against your wall, desk, or keyboard, until you actually get around to doing the damn thing.

Now what if I told you that you didn't have to experience this feeling, that you could take a pill and be able to harness the power of your own mind at its maximum potential?
Welcome to the world of nootropics.

Change Your Mind
The word "nootropic" was coined by Romanian psychologist and chemist Corneliu E. Giurgea, from the Greek word for mind (nous) and the verb to turn or change (tropikos). It's used to describe a category of drugs called cognitive enhancers, also known as smart drugs, which include stimulants (like the amphetamines found in Adderall, the #1 study buddy), cholinergic drugs (which act on chemical reactions between neurotransmitters), and a host of other natural and unnatural dietary supplements (such as ginseng and ginkgo biloba).
There is a pervasive myth about the human brain that we only use 10% of it, which has been soundly debunked by modern brain imaging technology, but serves as a great jumping off point for science fiction and fantasies of what we could do with increased brainpower.

The nootropic market got a big boost after the release of the 2011 thriller "Limitless," in which a writer played by Bradley Cooper starts taking a mysterious nootropic substance called "NZT-48" which supposedly unlocks the remaining 90% of his brain functions and allows him to become fantastically wealthy off of the stock market. The film ends (spoilers!) with the implication that he has figured out how to retain his superhuman intelligence without the drug (after much drama involved in acquiring and synthesizing it to maintain a supply) and that he will become president of the United States. If only being superintelligent were actually a prerequisite for that position...


Image via Wikipedia

"Lucy," a very similar film from 2014, finds a drug mule played by Scarlett Johannson accidentally absorbing a large quantity of a nootropic with the same purported ability to unlock the unused parts of the brain, and she ends up (spoilers again!) transforming and transcending human form to become a space-and-time-defying supercomputer. And this isn't the first time Scarlett Johannson has been featured in a transhumanist narrative ...is there something we don't know about ScarJo?
While most people are simply entertained by the hyperbolic nature of these outcomes, others may have walked out of the theater thinking "Where can I get my hands on some of this stuff?"

Get Limitless Here
Enter "Limitless Life," found at literally "get limitless here" dot com. They sell "experience enhancing supplements," including Katy: "a brand NEW, legal, all-natural, organically grown, plant-based nootropic supplement that will bliss you out." Marketed towards both health-conscious ravers and performance-enhancement-seeking biohackers, it's supposed to make you feel good while it makes you smarter, but it seems that most people who would try this instead of your average festival drugs are already pretty smart.




Supplement-peddling startups like Nootrobox (now known as "HVMN") market directly to the Silicon Valley crowd claiming to increase energy, focus, and creativity.

"The human drive to self-improve is timeless, but modern technologies now allow us to enhance in precise and measurable ways like never before."

Different supplement blends like RISE, SPRINT, and YAWN are optimized for different parts of your day. These mixtures of nootropics are commonly called "stacks."
Stacking supplements is where some of the actual biochemistry comes in. We know that choline is important for helping neurotransmitters work, so a choline supplement will usually form the base of the stack along with a "racetam," like piracetam. The mechanism that makes racetams grease your thinking gears isn't really understood, but they can sometimes act as stimulants as well. And speaking of stimulants, there's almost always a nice big dose of caffeine in a nootropic stack so you can really feel the brain juices flowing.




Many of the other chemical compounds used in nootropic stacks are supposed to improve working memory, or increase your general health and well-being like fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins like B12, which are mood-boosting and often featured in energy drinks. It turns out dopamine has a lot to do with productivity, so feeling good is half the battle.  

But Do They Really Work?
Everyone knows drinking a cup of coffee or smoking a cigarette (even though it seems relaxing, nicotine is a stimulant!) can help you reset your mindframe and get into work mode. But all those other fancy chemicals, do they actually do anything?
Because of the increasing popularity of nootropics, anecdotal evidence for their effectiveness continues to spread – check out /r/nootropics if you want to read stories from hundreds of willing guinea pigs-turned-amateur-neuroscientists, but their use as performance enhancers in healthy adults has yet to be scientifically proven. Most nootropics have been shown to be effective in treating memory disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. The majority of research into memory-increasing drugs and chemical supplements is geared towards people who are losing their memories, not towards healthy brains that wish they could be better.
It could be that the simple distraction of taking that coffee or smoke break is what actually works, and not the stimulants themselves (though most likely it's both). The same goes with taking the time to optimize your health with supplements – if you have time to performance enhance, then you probably have time to give your brain a natural boost through exercise, relaxation, or other proven ways.

Or it could be the effect of another well-documented neurobiological phenomenon.
The placebo effect can actually trick your brain into releasing some of that dopamine that you wanted in the first place, even if the drugs don't do it.
According to research from the journal Thinking and Reasoning, summarized by The Science of Us, there is a real neurological phenomenon happening where most people find that they are most creative, or able to come up with unorthodox solutions to problems, when their mind is wandering in the shower.
So while there's nothing that really exists to give you that "Limitless" effect, everyone is at their best after getting squeaky clean, and there's no reason not to take vitamins if you want to. Between pills and powders, placebos and showers, anything is better than applying your head directly to your keyboard.

In MONTAG's Today’s Dystopia series, our writers explore the dystopian worlds of classic fiction, and see if our world has slipped closer to the fictional one since it was published. Is our cool new technology bringing us closer to a future we’re afraid of - or is it already here?

Philip K. Dick's 1977 novel A Scanner Darkly was set in the then-distant future of 1994, and its resemblance to today's world is not coincidental: Dick based many of the events in the novel on his experiences living with drug addicts in the 70s, and he dedicates the end of the book to those people he based the characters on who died or suffered permanent consequences:

"This has been a novel about some people who were punished entirely too much for what they did. They wanted to have a good time, but they were like children playing in the street; they could see one after another of them being killed--run over, maimed, destroyed--but they continued to play anyhow. "

With the help of his then-wife Tessa, and Judy-Lynn del Rey, head of Ballantine Books' science fiction division at the time, Philip K. Dick set their stories in a familiar dystopia: the constant-surveillance police state. The book, and Richard Linklater's rotoscoped film adaptation in 2006 (featuring permanent dystopian protagonist Keanu Reeves), follow an undercover cop and addict named Bob Arctor, who is tasked with surveilling his own household, including himself.

Perma-dystopian Keanu via GIPHY

This vision of dystopia, with large portions of the population addicted to drugs churned out by a government which profits off of them and while persecuting them, draws on several themes that are present in all of Dick's fiction: mistrust and paranoia towards authority, loss of bodily autonomy and privacy, and identity crisis.
But how close have we really come to this version of Orange County in 1994? More than twenty years later, here's how the drugs, tech, and politics stack up on a scale from 1-5 little blue flowers.
Substance D: 4 out of 5 little blue flowers.

"There's no weekend warriors on the D, you're either on it or you haven't tried it."

"Mors Ontologica" is the scientific name of the little blue flower which is the source of Substance D. This fake Latin name translates to something like "metaphysical death," and the drug is also called "Slow Death," "Death," or simply "D."
While Dick clearly has empathy for his drug-addled protagonists, he does not glamorizing drug abuse or addiction in any way: we only see the negative effects of Substance D; the petty arguments, irritability, violence, paranoia and psychosis of addiction.
The opening of the film and the book is a memorable scene where Charles Freck, one of the addicts who lives in Bob Arctor's house, is convinced he is covered in bugs (specifically, aphids). He spends the first five minutes of the film scratching at himself, showering, bathing in bug spray, showering his dog, shaking and squirming.



Another addict named James Barris, who lives with Bob, tells him in a diner after this incident: "There's no weekend warriors on the D, you're either on it or you haven't tried it." According to another scene, 20% of the population at this point are classified as addicts.
According to statistics for 2015 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 10% of all people over age 12 in the US used illicit drugs in the prior month, and this number has been increasing over the last decade, since 2002. While this may not represent the true population of addicts, the US is also currently suffering from an opioid crisis, in which an estimated 2 million people are currently addicted to prescription pain relievers and/or heroin.
While statistics for 2016 and 2017 are not complete, the trend of increasing substance abuse and dependency leading to death shows no signs of slowing down.
And although the government isn't directly funding the production of opiates, allegations of drug trafficking by the US government, including the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s, put the Substance D phenomenon firmly on the side of plausibility.
Scramble suits: 4.8 out of 5 little blue flowers

via GIPHY

In the police state of the book and film, undercover narcotics agents are anonymized by "scramble suits" which protect their identities from other agents. This is how Bob is able to investigate his own household, and hide his identity as an addict from his employers (for some time).
The book explains that the technology in the suit was invented by someone named S. A. Powers at Bell Laboratories, after a psychedelic experience that sounds rather similar to Dick's own in 1974 which inspired his Exegesis writings and the book VALIS, among others:
"Basically, his design consisted of a multifaced quartz lens hooked to a miniaturized computer whose memory banks held up to a million and a half physiognomic fraction-representations of various people: men and women, children, with every variant encoded and then projected outward in all directions equally onto a super-thin shroud-like membrane large enough to fit around an average human. As the computer looped through its banks, it projected every conceivable eye color, hair color, shape and type of nose, formation of teeth, configuration of facial bone structure--the entire shroudlike membrane took on whatever physical characteristics were projected at any nanosecond, and then switched to the next."
(A Scanner Darkly, p. 12-13)
Without involving crystals or micro-computers, it's safe to say that facial recognition technology has already come a long way, and facial mapping is as common as Snapchat, so it should now be very possible to upload a bunch of human face data and randomize it to create a mask that would be undetectable, at least to a computer, as a single person.
Artist and technologist Kyle McDonald has already demonstrated something similar:



With the popularity of apps like Face Swap and augmented reality technology being developed by Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and literally hundreds of startups, there's an almost-zero chance that people won't be wearing others' faces for fun in real time, if not for anti-surveillance reasons.
And as for the rest of the suit, fashion designers like Adam Harvey have already been working on anti-surveillance clothing including HyperFace, a fabric designed to elude facial recognition algorithms by dint of too much data, Stealth Wear, which protects the wearer from body heat-seeking drone cameras, and CV Dazzle, arguably the most futuristic-looking hair, makeup, and clothing styles, which obscure the face from computer vision.



With these technologies already in place and only requiring their combination with some kind of membrane material discounted as an industrial byproduct, the scramble suit is practically extant.
Police state and 24/7 surveillance: 3.5 out of 5 little blue flowers
In his normal life, Bob Arctor is your average guy who is part of the population of Substance D addicts, and he is monitored like everyone else: phones tapped, location triangulated, and at risk for exposure and arrest at any time. The film shows a scene while he is on the phone with his dealer and girlfriend, Donna, in which someone is tracking both of their movements on a map via their cell phones, and can also zoom into any live image a la Google Maps and identify them using a seemingly comprehensive database of citizens.

via GIPHY

The government also regularly lets themselves into people's homes to install camera systems that monitor their behavior and employs agents to review these tapes, reporting and correlating suspicious activity related to drug use and trafficking. The government-funded rehabilitation facilities called New Path are the only place where people are not constantly scanned and monitored (which is a perfect place for the growers of the little blue flower to hide it).
While the ubiquity of technology like Google Maps and CCTV make this technically possible, the manpower required to run this kind of surveillance-state call center is unrealistic, it would all be done by computers correlating location and social media data.
And the government doesn't have to bother collecting the information themselves. The old-fashioned paranoia of bugged telephones or living rooms has now been supplanted by covering your webcam with a piece of tape.
We are all always already tracking ourselves voluntarily: geotagging Instagram and Facebook posts; Google Maps marking, Foursquare, and Yelping our favorite locations; connecting to the same circles of people as on our social networking platforms through 3 or more different messaging apps. If someone wanted to know your location 24 hours per day, it would be fairly easy to guess from all of this data, but the worst thing they will do with it now is try to sell you things.
Total score: 4.1 out of 5 little blue flowers

"Even though its technically a science fiction movie - we're living in science fiction right now,"

In an interview with Alex Jones, who features in the film briefly as an agitator with a bullhorn who is bundled into a black government van – more commentary on Jones' evolution from exactly this, to conspiracy-peddling media mogul (turned performance artist?) can be found here – Richard Linklater said of the story: "Even though it's technically a science fiction movie - we're living in science fiction right now."
And Today's Dystopia's score agrees: with a 4.1 out of 5 score, we can see clearly that A Scanner Darkly comes very close to being yesterday's tomorrow's dystopia today.

The fun and fantasy of an escape room comes from putting yourself in a situation you only see in movies and television: everyone gets a chance to play MacGyver or Bond, Sherlock or Houdini, whoever is your favorite hero of ontological mysteries. There is a puzzle to solve, and if you are observant and clever enough to manipulate key items around you, you win.
It's cerebral and physically active entertainment, and apparently an unbelievably lucrative business. And like all games, it reveals a lot about the humans who do it, how we choose to amuse ourselves: what's really fun about simulated peril? Do you want to see how well your work colleagues could defuse a bomb? Would you say yes to an escape room marriage proposal? And how do they stack up against an actual escape?
Let's ponder all of this and more, just follow me into this room... lock clicks behind you

via GIPHY

Escape
In the past ten years, escape rooms have popped up all over the world.  The first Escape Room was created in Japan in 2007 by SCRAP Entertainment, and was inspired by point-and-click adventure video games. From 2010 onward, they spread through Asia and Europe, with some of the highest concentrations in Budapest, then to Australia, Canada, and the USA. As of September 2017, there were 8,000 venues worldwide. If one hasn't opened up in your city, here's how they work:
Scott Nicholson, a Game Design professor from Ontario, has produced the most comprehensive study to date of escape rooms worldwide, entitled "Peeking Behind the Locked Door", and defines Escape Rooms as "live-action team-based games where players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal (usually escaping from the room) in a limited amount of time."
Essentially, Escape Rooms are mainstream Live Action Role Playing games (or LARP) – but instead of creating your own costumes, stories, and foam-covered weapons to boff each other with, you're provided a pre-made adventure, often with a distinct narrative and setting. Many escape rooms have been compared to haunted houses and immersive theater installations, but their true roots lie in puzzle and exploration games like Myst.



Approximately half of all escape rooms are set in a specific place and time from 1900 to today, but can also be set in the future or distant past. 36% of escape rooms, according to Nicholson's studies, have no overarching narrative other than "escape the room" or "escape a specific unpleasant place," like a prison, asylum, or a serial killer's basement.
In Russia, you can play a Soviet experience, where you have to destroy all of the incriminating documents in a dissident friend's apartment before the secret police come. In Berlin, you must smuggle messages to take down the Wall.
When escape rooms exploded in popularity in China, writers from both China Daily and the South China Morning Post commented on how young people in Hong Kong were using them to escape the stress of their daily lives, getting the same rush as video gaming but with even more immersion. For those who are exhausted by the chaos of life, escape rooms are an orderly simulation of a world where there are answers, even if they are hidden elaborately throughout the environment.
But it isn't only extreme escapists who want to test their wits in these environments: mommy bloggers say they're great for families, because they force everyone to look away from their phones from a moment and talk to each other; and others say they're a great first date idea. If there's no chemistry, no communication, or your date fails to wow you with their puzzle-solving expertise, you don't have to worry about being actually locked in with them for an hour: according to Nicholson's survey, the door isn't even actually locked in 22% of games.
I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me
According to MarketWatch's 2015 investigation into the escape room industry, corporate clients make up 50% of the escape room audience.
"Frothing" with your coworkers sounds like something only the trendiest startup offices would allow, or an HR violation – but it's actually terminology borrowed from LARP, that refers to the players' spirited post-game discussions. After an immersive, emergent gaming experience, the excitement that bubbles up and runs over, much like the head of an inexpertly-poured beer, can carry into the work environment and make colleagues communicate more creatively and work more closely as a team.
Plus, some escape rooms offer a full CCTV review for management to assess the experience, which at least anecdotally, has been used to determine natural leadership and potential for promotion.
Unfortunately, reports of a first date going too well caught on an escape room's CCTV were fake, but there are plenty of videos of marriage proposals. Usually these consist of the ring being hidden in the last clue to the room, and when you think about it, escape rooms are the perfect place to pop the question: a completely controlled environment, with everything being video taped, and the door locked. On a Reddit thread asking what are the weirdest things escape room employees have seen, one user witnessed a "Will you go with me to prom?" proposal, and (spoiler alert) she said no.
For those with an incredibly high tolerance for cringe, look no further than Escaping "The Room" with Tommy Wiseau, twenty minutes and forty-four seconds of YouTubers trying desperately to guide this creative genius through a series of puzzles in a recreation of the living room from his cult film The Room.



Breaking out, breaking in, and just generally breaking things

via GIPHY

Most of the other horror stories from Reddit consist of people breaking things, so that game operators have to write on specific objects, things like "Do not climb." But of course, as an inquisitive player, you could always interpret that as a clue to definitely climb (and break) their props. Other popular methods of destroying escape rooms include tearing up the floorboards and climbing up into the ceiling tiles, a method of escape actually used by a murder suspect in Las Vegas and caught on camera:



There has also already been at least one documented case of a burglar breaking into an escape room, and calling 911 when he couldn't get out.
For escape rooms of the future, however, proprietors won't have to worry about the property damage that people who try to brute-force or speedrun their way through the puzzles inflict on the environments they've meticulously built, because escape rooms have already been created for Virtual Reality. It's a perfect use case: an immersive experience with endless objects and puzzles to generate, and particularly convincing for the horror genre, as VR zombies are much more disgusting and realistic than human actors.



Much like Alternate Reality Games, escape rooms have become a shrewd marketing tool, with branded experiences appearing for TV series like The Walking Dead and Dr. Who, and to build hype around movies like Rogue One.
Whether they're the future of advertising or will peter out like ARGs is yet to be determined. But if you really want to escape the stresses of your daily life, take out your passive aggression on your work colleagues, or make a smashing proposal, may we suggest a Rage Room instead?

Twitter is hell

I hope you log off, I hope we both log off

If you are one of the over 300 million people who is active on Twitter, you know that Twitter is hell.
The constant churning of the news cycle, the political blustering and infighting, the insanity of the modern world, prove there is always something new to be enraged and distraught about, and people regularly banter about how miserable the Twitter feed makes them in their daily life.
Larissa Pham (@lrsphm), a writer from Brooklyn, put it best in a Tweet that went viral in September with over 115,000 likes:


"this AM my therapist reminded me that it's ok to go offline bc we arent made to process human suffering on this scale, &now i pass it on 2 u"

However, we don't go offline. We are in hell and for some reason we stay there, commiserating.
In homage to the homicidal-suicidal ideation of a man whose marriage is failing in The Mountain Goats song "No Children," Jackson Tyler (@headfallsoff) writes:


"I hope you log off, I hope we both log off"

But there is some beauty in this place of great pain.
According to a recent study, 48 million, or about 15 percent of Twitter users are bots.
While some of them are bot swarms deployed for nefarious, propagandistic purposes, other bots make art.
Some of them are even trying to provide a respite from the madness.
Glitch mob
One family of glitch art Twitter bots has been produced by poet B.J. Best (@bjbest60). On his personal website he has written what he calls a "manifesto / explanation / exploration of art bots and the ArtyBot family" called The Art of the Bot.

A bot never tires.  A bot never sleeps.  A bot never runs out of paint or ideas.  And, most importantly:  a bot can’t be threatened, bullied, or censored into not making art.

Having a desire to create art, but not satisfied with his artistic skill level, he has created a group of bots that generate and manipulate images amongst themselves. @ArtyBots is the ringleader but also, "a glorified mailman. It will invent and paint a fairly simple picture based on random equations, and then randomly choose another bot to receive it."



Other bots include @ArtyAbstract, which manipulates photos sent to it via Twitter into abstraction, and @ArtyCrush which reduces images to eight colors.
ArtyCurve makes them curvy, ArtyFractals imposes fractal-esque patterns. ArtyMash mashes together images pulled randomly from Flickr, and ArtyNegative inverts the colors of whatever it's given.
ArtyPetals creates kaleidoscopic blooming abstracts with a "drunkard's walk" through the pixels, ArtyShapes adds randomly colored shapes, and ArtyWinds "scatter[s] its pixels in a certain direction, as if wind was blown across the image and the pixels were grains of sand."
@ArtyOriginals retweets work by all of the Arty Bots, allowing a follower to see the end result of their collaboration without a bunch of half-processed images clogging up their feed.



B.J. answers some common questions in The Art of the Bot, such as "Are the images your bots create art?" To which he replies, "Yes. Simply, yes."
And when asked "What can bots do that human artists can't?" he emphasizes that the bots work tirelessly, and that there is some political statement formed by their relentless creativity:

"A bot never tires.  A bot never sleeps.  A bot never runs out of paint or ideas.  And, most importantly:  a bot can’t be threatened, bullied, or censored into not making art. Thus, an art bot has a whiff of political protest in it.  We live in a world where we are daily told that beauty doesn’t matter. This is reaffirmed by politicians, newsmakers, and those inhabiting Internet comment sections... An art bot is indefatigable.  It, and by extension its creator, will continue to attempt to create something beautiful every hour, every day, regardless of political sentiment or regime."

There are tons of other bots making art by similar methods of algorithmic re-composition. One notable bot creator is Way Spurr-Chen, (@wayspurrchen), creator of PixelSorter and curator of Glitchet, a weekly email newsletter about futuristic technology and resource for glitch artists.



PixelSorter (@pixelsorter) uses a number of random presents to manipulate images it's sent and is currently in dialogue with ArtyBots and another glitch-oriented art bot called @botisionista.
In 2014, PixelSorter entered into conversation with Quilt Bot (@a_quilt_bot) and several news outlets (including Vice's Creators) took notice. It seemed that their exchange of images would go on forever, eventually culminating in the ultimate work of glitch art. Sadly, their streak was ended when another bot creator (@jleedev) attempted to introduce a third bot (@badpng) into the conversation.



For more images based on bot exchanges, there's also a bot for that: @imgconvos  creates GIFs based on conversations between bots where you can see the progression of image degradation. Incidentally, this bot was also created by @thricedotted, real name unknown, who co-created @badpngbot, the harbinger of the end of the previously mentioned famous bot exchange.

Because of the different algorithms that these art bots use to create and manipulate images, no two bot-generated artworks are alike. They vary in levels of human-likeness and human intervention, and some (like @tweegeemee) keep track of how well their images perform in terms of likes and retweets, and use that feedback to create more images like them.
But as unique as each individual artwork is, there is something similar about them all. As you may have noticed, the image manipulation techniques tend to produce a lot of TV-static effects, supersaturated rainbow vomit, and creepy melted semi-abstract images (particularly when human faces are part of the source imagery).



David Kraftsow (@dontsave)'s bot @youtubeartifact has recently gotten a lot of attention for its sometimes-disturbing glitch images which take advantage of the YouTube mp4 codec. Engadget called it a "digital impressionist daydream". The bot originally started as its own website in 2009, was turned into a standalone app for digital art anthology and archive Rhizome.org in 2012, and only became an active Twitter bot last year, in 2016. Using datamoshing and his own secret sauce of video curation keywords, Kraftsow's images produced by the bot are close enough to recognizable YouTube stills to be unsettling.
Self-soothing via alternate universe

There is a Bot Bob Ross

We started exploring the world of Twitter bot art to get away from the horrors of the news cycle and ended up in a glitchy hellscape... so let's return to the path of peace with a bot made to emulate the most soothing artist of all time.
That's right, there is a Bot Bob Ross.
According to the bio of the bot @JoyOfBotRoss, "In 1985, Bob Ross labored to bring The Joy of Painting to home computers. A floppy with his code was found in a PBS station and turned to a bot by @R4_Unit."
But unfortunately, the bot's origin is fictitious. On his Bitbucket page, Brent Werness (@R4_Unit) explains how he chose the year of the bot's origin, based on the computer processes he wanted the bot to paint with. Particularly, he expresses a distaste for the overuse of Perlin fractal noise, a type of procedural texture in computer graphics, that he feels is overused in glitch art.
The bot uses text from The Joy of Painting and builds up images the way Bob did - starting with his magic white background, adding little fluffy clouds and happy little trees next, and so on. Werness writes, "If you watch many episodes, you'll see that he worked though intentionally simple means and always in the same general patterns: trees were always a back shadow layer, followed by trunk, followed by leaves. I tried to respect these rules, both since they work quite well, and to try to be authentic to the source. "

There are other bot artists trying to create a peaceful world for us to escape into as well.
In an article with the slug, "the art bots that make Twitter worth looking at again," Ars Technica has highlighted the work of Icelandic artist Michael Christophersson (@madebyflame) whose bot @veilbymist creates dark but playful abstract color fields, and George Buckenham (@v21), who created @softlandscapes.
The soft landscapes consist of pastel and gradient colored mountain ranges and cloud banks that are like macarons for the soul. They're light and pleasant to look at, they melt in the mouth of the mind's eye, and one can imagine roaming through them without a care in the world.



Other tiny alternate universes are being created by Katie Rose Pipkin (@katierosepipkin), a prodigious Twitter artist and bot maker who has created @tiny_star_field, an ASCII-character based bot with over 115,000 followers. There are several other bots creating night sky-scapes, like @C0NSTELLATI0NS, and @daft_stars which creates new heavenly bodies and descriptions of their meanings.



@LofiCloudBot generates cloud banks, while @tinyIsles creates endless fictional tropical paradises from an aerial view. @moon_rise_bot and @SunsetGenerator create calming images depicting the passage of time in vibrant colors. There's a bot to create fields of wildflowers and a bot that generates tiny skylines of cities you can imagine visiting. There is even a bot that makes forests out of tree emojis.



These bots break up the stream of bad vibes with windows into other worlds.
They let you take a tiny mental break, a micro-vacation, from the endless shitstorm of content. Hide from the Hot Takes in a dream forest, relax on the beach of a procedurally generated island, and float away in the clouds.
You may never log off, but remember, the mute button is free. And we all suffer here together, with some people, art bot creators and the bots themselves, who try to make our self-imposed hell a more beautiful place to live.

Everyone knows by now that experiences, not things, make us happy. But what if you could pay your way into a simulated experience of limitless bliss?

Defining money is easy. Defining happiness? Not so much.
We've problematized modern money in this issue of MONTAG by trying to figure out what's next: credit, cryptocurrency, or capitalism's collapse. So for the purposes of this article, let's just call money "money," and assume the status quo: that money is necessary for survival, and can also be used to buy things purely for pleasurable purposes.
Most research into whether money can buy happiness says that once you've reached the point that the amount of money you have pays for your basic physiological and safety needs, the amount of happiness money can give plateaus.


Image by Carl Richards, via The New York Times


Michael Norton, a professor at the Harvard Business School and co-author of Happy Money: The Science of Smart Spending, lists a few things you can spend money on that will actually correlate to increased happiness:

buying experiences (instead of things, because memories are forever, while stuff is not)
denying yourself or delaying consumption (and then splurging, instead of perpetually indulging, to trick yourself out of hedonic adaptation)
buying time (paying others to do things you don't enjoy, increasing net happiness by decreasing unpleasurable tasks)
and "investing in others" (giving to charity, or spending money on other people)

Researchers in 2006 measured the physiological response to charitable giving based on activity in a few areas of the brain: one of which is the orbitofrontal cortex, which has been linked to reward and hedonic pleasure (also known as happiness). The same area was monitored in a study of whether knowing wine is expensive increased consumers' enjoyment, and the answer was yes, people did have a stronger pleasure response to wine that they thought cost more money.
So if you were looking for the short answer to whether money can buy happiness, it's affirmative. But why stop there, when through trying to answer this question we've figured out which parts of the brain manufacture the sensation we call happiness? Why not use technology to press that button as often as possible?
The Experience Machine
The Experience Machine is a thought experiment by Robert Nozick that questions the limits of hedonism and asks exactly this question. In its simplest form, you can enter a simulation in which everything that can possibly make you happy happens. You choose the life you want to experience in a simulation while floating in a tank and unaware that you are living inside of the simulation, and there is no reason for you to exit it, except to potentially rotate the menu of experiences. Would you plug in?


Illustration of the Experience Machine by Wait But Why

Most people, including Wait But Why's Tim Urban, say they wouldn't, because of existential FOMO: "I thought about the real world going on all around me while I lay unconscious in a vat forever, missing everything."
Alan Watts tackles another aspect of this question in his Cosmic Drama: won't we get bored of everything in our simulated lives making us perfectly happy?

"If our technology were to succeed completely, and everything were to be under our control, we should eventually say, 'We need a new button.' With all these control buttons, we always have to have a button labeled SURPRISE"

But there is an argument to be made for plugging in to the Experience Machine and embracing hedonism, as The Matrix's turncoat Cypher explains while enjoying juicy and delicious simulated steak. Even if you know it's simulated (which, in the thought experiment, you do not) there is no way not to enjoy it.

Life is but a game?

"Life is a dream for the wise, a game for the fool, a comedy for the rich, a tragedy for the poor" – Sholem Aleichem

Simulated realities in science fiction ask us to question whether we would change everything about our experience of life if we could through technology. And with technological advances like virtual and augmented reality allowing for every day more lifelike, realistic simulations at our fingertips, how long will it be until we're faced with the choice of living in a technologically-mediated more perfect reality 24/7?
The next logical step would be to connect the simulation directly to brain-computer interfaces where it can be launched at the press of a button without unwieldy headgear or screens. And at that point we might as well be in the vat.

via GIPHY

To return to Michael Norton and others' assertions that experiences are the one thing you can buy that are guaranteed to give you happiness, why exclude simulated experiences that aren't fully immersive, just immersive enough – like video games?
Josh Taylor argues in "Why Robert Nozick Should Have Played More Video Games," that MMORPGs already allow users to participate in an Experience Machine of sorts, without the real-world FOMO or the lack of interpersonal interaction.
While many inhabitants of Second Life, which still has over half a million regular users, are also constructing and living alternative lives within the game that they can engineer for maximum satisfaction.
And technology will only get better – Linden Lab's VR portal Sansar is still in beta, but it's almost guaranteed that some people, if given the opportunity to live full time in a virtual world of their own creation, would choose it over living IRL.
Full immersion in a virtual world designed just for you isn't exactly possible yet, but when it is (not if), the Experience Machine will no longer be purely a thought experiment: it'll be the most happiness money can buy.

Video games might not be rotting our minds like our parents feared, but they might be in the process of creating entirely new minds for us to inhabit. As VR and AR proliferates, the gap between the "real world" and a game world is becoming blurred. So how would you live your life if you knew it were just a game…?

"Are you really alive, and does it even matter?" is rapidly becoming the most relevant question for humanity.
“What is the meaning for our existence?” has long been the most fundamental philosophical question of our lives.  It is the entire reasoning behind the strand of philosophical thought known as Existentialism.  Why are we here and what are we supposed to be doing?
For thousands of years, things were pretty simple, in evolutionary terms.  Our goal was to reproduce to keep the bloodline going and protect and care for our families.  Existence through genetics.  With the religious revolution this transformed to how best to serve God, an almighty, omnipotent presence whose judgement on your life became your ticket to eternal existence.
Through the Enlightenment and Industrial revolutions it was all about growth, progress and being a constructive member of a society pushing ever forwards into perpetuity.
And as we have begun to understand our general insignificance, the twenty-first century hedonistic age drives us to answer that question with a shrug of the shoulders and a pursuit of happiness at all costs, enjoying our brief time on this earth.
But all this is about to be replaced with a more fundamental question entirely.  One that takes a step back from meaning, to an understanding of state and reality.  Quantum existentialism, if you will.
The question becomes: Do we exist?  And then we are forced to ask ourselves: does it matter?

Some scientists, philosophers and megalomaniac entrepreneurs believe it’s highly likely, almost certain, that we live in ersatz reality.
Elon Musk suggests the probability is around a one in a billion chance that what we know of as real life is indeed that, and not an elaborate simulation by a more intelligent species, or potentially our future selves.
Let’s explore that concept by playing a simple game of extrapolation.
Forty years ago, the most advanced computer game was a small pixelated dot traveling back and forth across a 2-dimensional screen between two small, human-controlled lines that could move up or down. Pong was revolutionary, fun and the closest you could get to playing tennis while doing zero exercise.

Five years ago, gamers playing Grand Theft Auto V could dive into San Andreas, a huge world, created in a studio and take a first person exploration through an interactive universe that allowed for all kinds of real life experiences like driving a car, sky-diving and blowing up yachts full of gangsters.

Gamers interact through a lens, a separated layer of avatars and controllers. Today, that lens is being shattered.

But even in that world, gamers interact through a lens, a separated layer of avatars and controllers, albeit far more complex ones than Pong.  Today, that lens is being shattered.
Virtual reality gaming is enabling those designed experiences to become ever more immersive with touch and movement alongside the traditional sight and sound.  Pressing a button to interact with the world around you will soon feel as alien as picking up a quill to start writing.
Indeed, a beta version of GTA:V that allows you to “more naturally aim, shoot, move, teleport and select your weapon” already exists for Oculus and HTC Vive. More games, as well as interactive movie experiences, are inevitably on their way.
With the exponential growth in computing capabilities driven by Moore’s law, the increasing accessibility of gaming through the democratisation of hardware and the creativity of people to not just fantasise but create virtual worlds, it’s not too difficult to envision a game, forty years from now, that is just as real and just as complex and just as immersive as what we call “real life” today.

What about 100 years from now?  How about a  thousand?
Assuming nothing catastrophic happens to our society (which is a big assumption, writing from the brink as we do in 2017) and technology and societal change continues at current pace, these games will cease to be called games and start being alternate realities.
Realities that we can jump into simply by switching on a screen, donning a headset – or perhaps just blinking our eyes.
Feel like climbing Everest this morning before breakfast?  No problem, take a virtual sherpa with you. Feel like transporting yourself back to 1980s Miami and becoming a drug lord?  Sure, you can do that if you really want (although might we recommend the virtual world of a therapist’s studio instead?).  Feel like peeking around the edge of tomorrow and transporting yourself to the future?  The prediction and modelling algorithms of our world and human behaviour will be so advanced you can even do that.
These experiences will become seamless to us in the way putting your glasses on to read, switching on the TV or Skyping with your grandparents have all become.
Books, television and computers are all media through which we reach beyond our immediate world and find something intriguing, engaging or perhaps just reassuringly familiar.  New worlds and realities will inevitably become the same.


If our world is the reality, the morals of game design become incredibly important as the world's software engineers begin to create new ones for us.

So, let’s re-enable beard-stroking mode and return to the philosophical question.
If these worlds become so good that they are indistinguishable from reality, how will we know when we enter them and when we leave?  Will some realities seem more real than the others?  What can we grasp onto to, what totems should we carry, to reassure us that we’re currently in the base reality?
If we assume that our world is the reality, the morals of game design become incredibly important, as software engineers in studios around the world begin to create new ones for us.  Not sociologists, not politicians.  These design decisions increasingly shape the way we interact in virtual space and how we bring those habits and attitudes back into our reality
Conversely, if we assume that our world is not the base reality then we can just continue with our hedonistic approach to enjoying the ride, with little care or caution what impact that creates on the environment, our fake relationships and even our own bodies.
Maybe we have an ethical responsibility to do even wilder things so we increase the experimental learnings of whatever superior being is watching and learning from our every move and decision.

In tribute to the godfather of existentialism, we’re left with a simple Either/Or: either we live in a reality or we live in the reality.
In either scenario, the only real difference appears to be what we do with it: how would you live your life if you knew it were just a game?

Enjoy laughing at Artificial Intelligence's attempts at creating art while you can, because as soon as AI gains sentience, there'll be no more disrespect allowed.

You see a message at the end of an email newsletter written in Morse code. It translates to the URL for a website which contains a creepy looping video and nothing else. You inspect the source code of the web site and find a link to a private sound file. You listen ... and you have fully descended down the rabbit hole of an Alternate Reality Game.
Alternate Reality Games, (or ARGs) are games that emphatically express "This Is Not A Game." Their stories blend into the real world as platformless narratives, stories that overlay an alternate reality through fragments of text, video, events, objects, and more. They can be played by millions as part of viral marketing campaigns, or never discovered. And the spirit of discovery is key to a good ARG: they're designed to attract and mobilize a hive mind, groups of people who trip down the rabbit hole (also known as the "trailhead") and are expected to work together to find and decode bits of the story to progress, with their actions often influencing the outcome of the game.

"An ARG is like playing an RPG with two million of your closest friends."

The first ARG discovered was a mixture of technology and the supernatural called Ong's Hat, after the real-world ghost town of Ong's Hat, New Jersey – not far from where the Jersey Devil and other cryptozoological creatures haunt the forests and freeways. According to the lore of the game, a group of scientists from Princeton University exploring chaos theory and quantum physics in the 1980s discovered a theory for interdimensional travel using a device called The EGG, and produced some spooky results. Their research was published as a series of documents known as The Incunabula Papers, which were scattered around 1990s internet message boards like alt.conspiracy and alt.illuminati. Theories appeared in print magazines and online, and the full story eventually spanned online text documents, print, radio, television, and CD-ROMs, until the game's creator (known in ARG lingo as the "puppetmaster" of Ong's Hat) Joseph Matheny ended the story in the early 2000s.
ARGs often have a hint of the supernatural or science fictional, and always have a conspiratorial subtext: they exist in plain sight, making you question the world around you. They're at the cutting edge of interactive fiction, but they have also been used for commercial purposes.

The next most famous example was 2001's The Beast, an ARG created by Warner Bros. as a viral marketing effort for the Steven Spielberg film A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Dubbed "the Beast" by its creators due to the fact that its asset list contained 666 files, The Beast's storyline revolved around a murderous artificial intelligence entity. Players were introduced to the game by searching the name of a fictional person who appeared in the credits of the movie's trailer as a "Sentient Machine Therapist" named Jeanine Salla. The players, who numbered over three million people by the end of the summer of 2001, found hundreds of websites, phone numbers, and physical locations to find out who she was and what happened. A now-defunct hardcore group of players calling themselves The Cloudmakers continued maintaining archives of the in-game websites until September 2013.

As the largest, most engaging ARG to date, The Beast set an example for many other ARGs as viral marketing tactics. The next most notable was 2004's I Love Bees, which was created by the interactive marketing agency 42 Entertainment for Xbox's release of Halo 2, and oddly used a beekeeping website as its rabbit hole. I Love Bees led players to pick up ringing payphones in 210 locations where they would hear 30-60 second clips from a radio drama set in the future, or participate in live phone calls with characters creating a real-time interactive narrative. I Love Bees also included jars of honey sent to previous ARG players, and drew 250,000 visitors in its first month alone, with three million total in three months.


Image via Wikispaces

42 Entertainment were also the minds behind the ARG leading up to the release of the Nine Inch Nails album Year Zero. Its rabbit hole was a hidden code on the back of their tour T-shirts, USB flash drives dropped in the bathrooms at shows, and images hidden in spectrogram recordings of songs. The game described a dystopian 2022 in the U.S., where the government drugs the population into submission and causes mass hallucinations of a giant hand known as "The Presence" coming from the sky. A rebel group from the future known as Solutions Backwards are sending the clues found in the game to the present to prevent this dystopian future.
"Serious ARGs" try to direct the collective intelligence and problem-solving of ARG players towards global issues like 2007's World Without Oil, funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and ITVS, which let players explore and play out responses to the peak oil crisis, and 2008's Traces of Hope, a game about civilians caught in global conflicts by The British Red Cross (formerly located at tracesofhope.org, a domain which is now owned by cryptocurrency evangelists).
As evidenced by Wikipedia's List of alternate reality games, the success of these games as viral marketing efforts caused an ARG boom in the noughties: a few other notables included an ARG for the TV show LOST, as well as the movies Cloverfield and The Dark Knight.
Although there are still ARGs running for current TV shows like Mr. Robot, their popularity as a marketing technique has faded in the last ten years or so, and ARGs have quietly returned to their roots in the microhorror or creepypasta genre – scary could-be-true stories that spread through various internet media channels, supported by text, video, and hidden messages, often based on new folklore or dystopian alternate reality scenarios.
ARGs are particularly thriving on YouTube, where series like lonelygirl15 and Marble Hornets have engaged millions of viewers with their fragmented fiction.



ARGNet lists games that are ongoing, including play-by-mail games like the Mysterious Package Co., online escape rooms, and mainstream augmented reality games like Pokémon Go. You can browse the forums of Unfiction and Lateral Realities to find theories and even more trailheads. And of course, there are subreddits with subreddits devoted to sharing trailheads and clues.
Kyle Perkins has compiled a list of the Top Ten Alternate Reality Games of 2018 including two called Eckva and The Church Of Higher Truth, whose starting points (embedded below) hit just the right balance of intriguing aesthetics and lack of information to whet your appetite:






One of the most active ARGs today is The Sun Vanished, a story told through Twitter in which "the sun has disappeared and all power has stopped. Dangerous beings utilizing flashing lights to kill or convert humans into strange creatures roam the earth in search of survivors." Its followers, who now number 315,000, interact by voting in Twitter polls, reading updates, and tweeting at the characters. While some Redditors argue that it's not actually an ARG, the beauty of Alternate Reality Games is that they can happen anywhere, anytime, and incorporate anything from the real world and the internet.
You might even find one right here, on montag.wtf ...


TRIPLE TROUBLE! In Episode Three:
• Kathryn explains how, even though 2017 is terrible, we're still not completely in the dystopian world of The Handmaid's Tale (but are still pretty close.)
• Joe tries to justify how recording your loved ones as a VR object and re-animating them after they die is actually a great idea (and Kathryn spots an opportunity for fiendishness)
• Thom proves frighteningly adept at guessing the answers to Kwizmaster Kathryn's quiz on how Victorians used flowers to throw some old-time shade.

• TODAY'S DYSTOPIA: The Handmaid's Tale

It's often said that the world feels like a dystopia at the moment. In MONTAG's Today's Dystopia series, our writers take a sideways look at fictional dystopias, compares them to reality, and ask: how close are we to living in tomorrow's dystopias today?

Pop culture allegories don’t get much more “pop” than They Live. Its main star is a pro wrestler, it’s directed like a low-budget 80s MTV video, the script is curt, unfussy and full of holes. There’s a lengthy, seemingly gratuitous and unintentionally hilarious six minute street fight - over a pair of sunglasses - in the middle of it all.
And yet with each year that passes since its 1988 release, They Live reveals itself more and more to be a stiletto-sharp appraisal of the consumerism, capitalism, and inequality that saturates society – and how it is slowly, silently strangling us, right under our noses.



They Live is as much of a horror movie as director John Carpenter’s other more famous films, The Thing and Halloween. But instead of supernatural shocks and spills – and despite the bad guys being aliens – the film's allegory is so crystal clear that viewers will be in shock as they experience creeping dread.
Because, the viewer might reasonably conclude: in They Live, the horrorshow is real, and not only are we living in it every day, but we’re helping it consume us.

The premise is as stupendously silly as it is simple: a homeless, jobless man played by wrestler “Rowdy” Roddy Piper searches for employment in LA. He’s at the bottom of the heap, as his surname, Nada – meaning “Nothing” in Spanish – makes clear, and his struggle to find work is juxtaposed with the wealth and rampant consumerism of Reagan’s 1980s.
via GIPHY
Having broken into a closed church to find a place to stay (here sounds the first of many ALLEGORY KLAXONS), John finds an unmarked cardboard box full of sunglasses. In the glaring Los Angeles sunshine, he slips a pair on – and to his horror, they reveal the real world to him for the very first time.



A gigantic wealth gap between the gilded top 10% and a vast population of people who don’t know when they’ll be paid next? A bloated middle class who believe that ultra-wealth is just within their grasp if only they keep working themselves into the ground?
Bombardment of multimedia messaging seducing us to part with cash for products that’ll get us that bit closer to the elite? A corrupt ruling class that promises us everything is better than ever?
Anything sound familiar to you?
Slip on your sunglasses as we peer into the cold heart of 2017 and compare how close today is to the dystopia of They Live. We’ll mark each scenario out of five sunglasses (🕶), in honour of John Nada’s iconic shades.

Hyper-commerciality and persuasion to conform and spend: 🕶 🕶 🕶 🕶
via GIPHY
The glasses in They Live reveal the real message of billboards: the stark command OBEY. Ads featuring bikini-clad babes are a front for MARRY AND REPRODUCE; lifestyle magazine covers reveal CONFORM; radio transmitters drone the message SLEEP…. SLEEP… 24 hours a day.
John Carpenter said that They Live sprung from a realisation that the apparently bubbling economy and positive messaging from politicians had a distantly-connected flip side: he was constantly being pitched products.

"I began watching TV again. I quickly realized that everything we see is designed to sell us something... It's all about wanting us to buy something. The only thing they want to do is take our money.”

Nearly 30 years after They Live was filmed, what do 2017’s creative minds think about the persuasively commercial nature of media today?
Edgar Wright, director of hit movies Baby Driver and Shaun of the Dead, tweeted, “If you remade They Live now, the twist would be that you don’t even need the glasses.”

But why? Maybe it's because the tools we use to interact with the world are so blatantly manipulative and the people that use them are so blatant in their manipulation.
Facebook’s “Data God” was Jeffrey Hammerbacher. He figured out how to slice up all the data they have on you, whih then helped the social media giant make more money than all the gods combined.
He left Facebook because he was tired of seeing, in part, creativity drained from the most gifted people. His off-the-cuff observation - “the best minds of my generation… are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.” - has become a defining comment on our digital age.
There's an icky amorality to the work of these brightest minds,  working at social media apps, dating apps, video apps, indeed, any app that values your time; which is to say, all of them.
By eagerly copying the technology that keeps punters gambling on video slot machines, they literally want to make you addicted to their app.
via GIPHY
Why? To see more adverts, mainly.
And Banksy, whose brash people-pleasing work uses the public sloganeering of They Live to put anti-authority messages in front of millions, has some thoughts on advertising:

“The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little.”

OBEY, indeed.

A super-elite using technology to enslave humanity: 🕶 🕶 🕶

“They've Recruited the rich and the powerful - they’re running the whole show!”

Every time They Live’s hero pops on his magic sunglasses, he can see that the wealthy people around him are actually aliens who have secretly assimilated society, assumed wealthy positions of authority, and put in place a scheme to control the other 90%.
This majority – the humans – are told what to do, and what to ignore, through media, advertising and branding.
So far, so preposterous – although these out-there ideas are fairly well-worn IRL, too.
via GIPHY
Ex-Coventry City goalkeeper, ex-BBC broadcaster, self-proclaimed “son of God” and conspiracy theorist supremo David Icke believes that the world’s elite - notably, Queen Elizabeth II – are part of a shape-shifting reptilian race who enslave the rest of us.



Except – wake up sheeple: it’s actually our celebs who are in charge, and apparently it’s mainly female music stars. Beyonce is Satan; Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj and Shakira are lizards; meanwhile, there must be a lot of evenings put aside for world-domination planning in the Knowles-Carter household, as Jay-Z is also an Illuminati puppet.
OK, this is all ludicrous.
But if the powerful, wealthy, and hyper-influential cabal of celebrity family empires like the Kardashians or the Hadids could be considered to be our social “super elite,” then it’s not a wild leap to consider that their mastery of social media is – in a small way - “controlling” the hundreds of millions that elect to follow their idols.
And whenever one of these elite convinces a follower to buy the now-ubiquitous fitness teas, waist trainers and teeth whiteners, they trap one more puny, working-class human into a cycle of financial dependance.

Magic glasses that reveal the truth of the world around you: 🕶 🕶 🕶
The magic glasses part of They Live is the biggest reality-leap of all, and in 2017 the most insight a pair of glasses will give you about the ultra-elite is an indication of how much Silicon Valley’s tech zillionaires are splashing on their shades (SPOILER: it’s at least $150).
However, there is already technology to rival the most iconic of They Live’s props.
When the viewer finds out that billboards are duping our hero, the most striking realisation – after taking on board the huge plot twist – is an understanding of just how surrounded we are by adverts, billboards, images, and signage imploring us to buy... stuff.



If you slip on an augmented reality headset created by Brand Killer, you will experience the same revelation. The Brand Killer team trained their software to recognise any brand logos that stray into the wearer’s field of vision – and then blur them out.
Brand Killer is ad-blocker for real life, and it answers an utterly compelling question: what would your world be like if it was completely unsullied by brand logos and adverts? If you got access to Brand Killer’s tech, you could have your own John Nada moment: pop 'em on and find out for yourself.
However - and here, please do not adjust your aluminium foil hat - Brand Killer suggests how our tech overlords could grab a little more control over us.
Pretty soon, AR glasses will be everyday tech. So what if clever code like Brand Killer was used nefariously, and instead of spotting ads and blocking them, it replaced them with ads tailored specifically to us instead? You couldn't escape. And why would you want to?
OBEY.

In total: 3.5 sunglasses.
In summation: They do, indeed, Live! (Kind of.)
OK, maybe there aren’t aliens enslaving us (sorry, David Icke) but we certainly do seem to be our own worst enemies with regards to allowing our intentions to be "influenced" by those we follow online.
Maybe, then, the 2017 version of popping on John Nada’s glasses is to voluntarily switch on flight mode, and step away from the internet for a few days: only then can we truly OBEY ourselves.
In the meantime, enjoy the fight for acceptance of your real-reality, as allegorically thumped home in They Live's preposterous fight scene...




It once might have seemed facile for the real world to have been influenced by sci-fi: isn’t sci-fi supposed to describe a world that's out of reach? But in these heady, oddball times, it feels normal for impossible, philosophical future fiction to be coming true.
Richard Branson is selling tickets to space tourists. Elon Musk is openly making decisions based on The Hitch-Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov. Donald Trump seems to basing his leadership on that of President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho from Idiocracy.
So if weirdo ideas that were once the reserve of Sci-Fi are now #inspo for our reality, should we be looking to Sci-Fi as a serious indicator of the future? What does Sci-Fi tell us we’ll  be using to pay for stuff in the future? And could this form part of a sound investment strategy?*
We’ve looked at some classic speculative fiction and marked the likelihood of each currency emerging IRL out of five 💵.

Currency: Credits. Likelihood of adoption:   💵 💵 💵 💵
It’s boring. It’s simple. It’s obvious. It’s The Credit!
The TV shows Babylon 5, Star Trek, Firefly and Farscape. Movies Star Wars, Total Recall, and Demolition Man. Judge Dredd (the movie and the comics). The Ender’s Game books. Too many video games to count.
They all use the “Credit” as their future-currency. Does that mean that the Credit is the work of lazy writers? Or is it an acknowledgement that in the future, we’ll boil the concept of money down to something that works for everyone, and thus becomes boring by default, like Ed Sheeran?
The existence of the Credit is likely a latent expression of the latter: that homogeny = tedium. There are already examples of nouns invented to please everyone which shed their interest along the way. Just look at the linguistic knots that car manufacturers tie themselves into to create a worldwide brand name that appeals equally all over the globe: The Matiz, the Aveo, the Qashqai, the Aygo, the Yaris.
They're all interchangable, all non-descriptive, and all suggesting something vaguely purposeful, yet safe: like Hallmark Christmas movies or an All Day Breakfast In A Can.
(It’s also important that car brands don’t outright offend anyone either. Mitsubishi discovered this the hard way with their unfortunately-named Pajero, which means “wanker” in Spanish, and makes the manufacturer's decision to emblazen "Pajero" in large type across the back of the vehicle all the more amusing.)
Now, look at the de facto currency of tomorrow: Bitcoin. That the name was invented by the mysterious crypto-genius Satoshi Nakamoto means nothing - it may as well have been created by polling every mid-size marketing agency in the world and averaging out the results. We should be grateful that we ended up with "Bitcoin" - it could just have easily been the Credit.
So, all hail The Credit - a unit of currency that sounds like the kind of insanely dull thing that underpins a devastatingly exciting future. Four 💵 out of five.

Currency: The leaf. Likelihood of adoption:  💵 💵 💵 💵
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide To The Galaxy has made some tech predictions that are devastatingly accurate and wildly absurd all at once: the cross-language Babel Fish pretty much exists now, except it’s a boring plastic tech product and not an alien fish that lives in your ear canal, excreting language translations into your brain.
So while some of HHGTTG’s sci-fi currencies, like the Altairian Dollar, Flanian Pobble Bead, and Triganic Pu, are just silly names, one of them - the leaf - also straddles this same half-crazy/half-wise divide.
While the idea of the Leaf becoming a currency is a simple but wry gag in HHGTTG (finally, money actually grows on trees!), it might actually be kind of plausible. In the book, it emerges that humanity has actually descended from a bunch of people that another planet considered low-priority and sent to colonise the young and pristine earth millions of years ago.
Thus, these management consultants, telephone sanitisers and hairdressers  adopt the leaf as a currency and immediately all became immensely rich - and then have to find a way to deal with the consequential mass deforestation.
So far, so stupid. But using leaves as currency is not quite as dumb as it sounds.
There is even a precedent of sorts: leaves come from plants, plants can be used to make fabrics, and fabrics have historically been used as currency (it’s how the Silk Road got its name, for instance). And cotton is a constituent part of some banknote paper, and cotton grows on plants... so you could kind of argue that we’re already using leaves for our money.
And for Doomsday Preppers, the paranoid/enlightened (delete as appropriate) people who are preparing for a post-apocalyptic world, the leaf is an important potential currency.
The key to making leaves work as a currency is like any other currency: scarcity and inherent value. Tobacco, marijuana, coffee and spices are ideal candidates, and will all be especially desired in a dystopian world where your meagre diet of boiled rat might need perking up with some flavour and/or mind-altering distractions.
Whether the world ends in a flaming mass or not, our intrepid Preppers seem pretty determined to get off-grid and may well end up roaming the land, trading stuff for leaves - hence a surprisingly high probability score of four 💵 out of five.

Currency: Time actually becomes money. Likelihood of adoption:  💵 💵 💵 💵
In Time, the 2011 Justin Timberlake movie, features a future where everyone’s life is limited, and each person has, unfathomably, a countdown timer on their arm. While this gives the film a corny movie countdown-timer plot device, it also allows for some quite sophisticated reasoning: what happens when time literally becomes money? What if you make lots of money? Do you live forever? What if you steal someone else’s time?
There’s plenty of evidence to correlate wealth with life expectancy - in the US, rich people live up to 15 years longer than poorer people - so it’s already possible to “buy” an extension to your life, assuming you have the cash.
But using time as actual money itself? Well, anyone who has chosen between taking a day off work and earning some extra cash has essentially already used this currency, albeit in reverse.
And despite the value of time becoming the source of a million agonisingly cheesy Instagram meme-quotes, our money is starting to align more closely with the ticking of the clock.
Creating cryptocurrencies takes a defined amount of time: the complex calculations that need to be completed to “mine” slivers of coin take a long time, even with the most powerful processors. And people are so eager to conflate time and money in this way that there has been a worldwide shortage of GPUs as coin miners scramble to make as much virtual money in as short a time as possible. Because, you know, time = money.
It turns out that the hitherto absurd idea of using time as currency might actually be happening already, baby, and so four 💵 out of five might even seem a little conservative in that regard.

Conclusion: Leaves, credits, time itself - it’s all quite unexpectedly likely:  💵 💵 💵 💵

Disclaimer: None of this is a safe investment strategy. Do not invest in leafy bushes on the basis of MONTAG’s utterly unscientific claims.

However… there’s something exciting and eerily plausible about the idea of money as we know it vanishing and being replaced by fun, new stuff.
And as hyper-local currencies like the Brixton Pound have shown, there’s nothing to stop us just going out there and inventing our own unit of currency, and really making it work.
Go forth and make your money. But, really, don’t base your economy on leaves.

I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time



Friedrich Nietzsche famously said, “without music, life would be a mistake.” He was also a huge fan of opium and self-prescribed chloral hydrate, so maybe we should be wary of what he constitutes a “mistake.”
Either way, music is an essential, very human form of expression, bringing joy in a way that can’t be felt through words alone.
A beautiful song like “Wichita Lineman” by the recently departed Glen Campbell connects to virtually anyone on an emotional level - and yet conjures unique feelings in every listener.
For an activity we’ve been doing since people could bang one thing against another thing, the whole “humans making music” process seems to be working out just fine - so why are people trying to change it, and how?
In the first of a two-part look into the future of music consumption and creation, MONTAG asks these questions - and finds out how you can take advantage of AI to make music for yourself. Then, next week, we’ll find out how we shouldn't be scared of a future where our favourite music is made without human input...

C.R.E.A.M.



**The TL;DR to the question** “why are we headed for a future where my music is made by AI?” hovers somewhere between “lust for cash” and “the human desperation to innovate.” 
The way tech will change music can broadly be cleaved into two paradigms: music that will be made without any human input whatsoever, and music that is made by humans - but in a way which means handing off work to bots.
Neither of these options will fill musicians with anything other than existential dread. But it also might work out a lot better than they’d assume.

Automatic For The People

**Music is, by definition, compiled using a limited number of notes, chords and melodies**, and thus is ripe for automation. It’s made of the kind of patterns that computers find simple to analyse and replicate.
So AI-produced music will suck, right?
The short answer is no. The longer answer is also no, and - surprise! - you’re already listening to it. And it’s great.
Brian Eno is considered one of modern music’s wizards. A founding member of Roxy Music, he soon quit the band to invent his own type of music: Ambient - the warm, languid, slow music that is “as ignorable as it is interesting.”
It’s the type of music you could hear at airports, as the title of one of his pioneering LPs, Music For Airports, is at pains to point out.
Eno has been producing music that makes itself for decades. Generative music involves presenting a computer with a set of sounds and some loose parameters - and letting it create the music it concludes works best.



Recently, he released Reflection, an album that was released as an app that created the music anew each time it was launched: whenever you played it, it felt sonically familiar without actually being the same.
(And even if you listen to it on a streaming service, you will experience an element of its mutation: every few months Eno quietly uploads a different version of Reflection to a slightly confused - or impassive - audience.)
Reflection is a great album that challenges what an album - and music itself - is. In some ways this is nothing new - before recorded music existed, a song was always different every time you heard it.
But that’s Brian Eno. He produced a bunch of Bowie, U2, and Coldplay albums, and is considered a genius. What about the bedroom artists, or the rest of us music lovers?

B-Boy Bouillabaisse



Music that makes itself is not a threat to music. It might be a threat to the livelihood of the people that make it, but that’s the same issue that we’ll all be facing soon.
Instead, what are the ways music makers will be liberated, supercharged and energised by automation?



Rewind to 1989. It’s a sunny day in Los Angeles, and you’re on the roof of the Capitol Records building. There’s a weird new music playing that sounds like someone took little bits from a hundred classic soul and funk and rock and hip hop records and jigsawed them all together.
You’d be right to think that, ‘cos you’re drunk and you're at at the launch party of the Beastie Boys’ revolutionary Paul’s Boutique LP: an album that was, indeed, made from all those bits of records (and more). Here’s the interesting part: a record like Paul’s Boutique will never be made again.
The reason that it's one-of-a-kind will frustrate anyone who’s listened to the album and been struck by the dazzling scope, audacity (who’d have the guts to shuffle a collage of bits of Beatles songs into a new song?) and funkiness of the ultimate cut-n-paste record.
It’s because the band and their visionary producers, the Dust Brothers, broke the law. They grabbed all the best bits of all the records that they liked the best and, out of the parts, made one that was better. And they didn’t pay for any of these parts.
You can’t do this any more: copyright laws in the music industry have been tightened with industrial-strength monkey wrenches. Using a snippet of another song in your own costs so much money that it rarely makes financial sense.



In fact, it’s often financial insanity: the famous strings in The Verve’s Bittersweet Symphony is a sample of an orchestral cover of a Rolling Stones song, and as a result, the Verve had to pay every penny the song earned to Mick ’n’ Keef.

What Can You Do For Me?



Wait, what’s this got to do with automation? Two very important things.
Firstly, Paul’s Boutique was a turning point: when the musician openly evolved from being a writer of music to being a curator of sounds, noises and snippets.
Everything is a remix now, and it probably has Nicki Minaj doing a guest verse.
Secondly, and conversely: this cut ’n’ paste method of making music is normal now.
Open Garageband or any easy-to-use music-making software and you’ll see that making music involves nudging around virtual lego bricks: this drum beat here, this horn stab there, and this loop of a jazz-flute unaccountably gasping over the top of it all.
It’s long been common for composers to buy “packs” of samples, noises and loops of sound made for you to cut up, move around and make new songs from.
So what if a computer made them for you instead?

OK Computer



It takes half a dozen clicks to create a brand-new, never-before-heard song on Jukedeck, a service that uses AI to create brand new compositions.
Jukedeck is simple: fill in a few meaningful parameters (Choose “Corporate Tech” if you must) and make some tonal distinctions - and out pops a song that you can stream, download, or buy outright so that you are the actual owner of the composition.
This is great for podcasters who just want a piece of catchy music for their show, and can’t afford to hire a songwriter, or make it themselves.

MONTAG’s companion podcast, the MONTAGE, uses a “Cinematic Sci-Fi” song that we made on Jukedeck called Reckless Doubts  (a suspiciously fitting name for any of MONTAG’s activities).

Is This It?



Ho-hum, you might think: this isn’t real music. And you know - maybe it isn't.
Yet this is the very crux of tomorrow's human music-making paradigm.
Here's where the much-maligned human producer is creatively supercharged: why not use Jukedeck, or tomorrow’s more advanced version of it, to make 20 tracks, sample the best bits, and make something human, unique and utterly new from the fragments?
You might be making Paul’s Boutique 2.0 and it’d be the most “now”, most cutting-edge thing you could possibly do in music (at least, that’s what your breathless press release will say.)

So: automated music creation is not to be feared, it's not upsetting the apple cart as much as you'd think, and humans are going to be more essential than ever.
And next week, we find out why that's all wrong, and how you're already humming along to songs made by machines.

Most people know that by using our laptops, phones and tablets, we're creating a wealth of data about ourselves. By connecting to social networks, using e-commerce, and enjoying many forms of entertainment, we record information about us as consumers - and corporations are buying and selling this information.
In Part One of her look into the market value of our personal data, Kathryn Lawrence asks whether in the future we'll be able to profit off our own invisible data stream. And in Part Two, she'll look at other, more tangible, human byproducts...

What is your personal data?
In order to understand how much your data is worth, you first have to figure out what that data is.
Data brokers pay for three types of data: volunteered data (such as social media profiles), observed data (such as location data from cell phones), and inferred data (the combination of volunteered and observed data that can supposedly predict your future behavior as a consumer).
But they can also find plenty of your personal data out for free, from public records, governmental databases, and other publicly available sources:

Identification data (such as your name, address, email address)
Sensitive data (such as birthdays and social security numbers)
Court and public record data (such as criminal records and marriage licenses)
Home and neighborhood data (such as real estate listings)
Vehicle data (such as vehicle registrations and insurance)
General interest data (such as charitable donations)
Financial data (such as credit reports)
Travel data (such as frequent flyer information)
Purchase behavior data (such as what you buy and how you pay for it)
Health data (such as over-the-counter drug purchases and “ailment and prescription online search propensity”)

So the next time you end up on WebMD after Googling the symptoms of a common cold and managing to convince yourself it’s actually brain cancer, remember that a data broker somewhere is also laughing at your hypochondria.
And what are they using it for? “People search products,” which can be used to locate individuals for various reasons, are the least profitable (about a $52 million dollar industry as of 2012).
Then there are “risk mitigation products,” which use personal data for fraud detection and credit information – this industry is worth over $177 million.
And finally, marketing products, the largest industry trading our personal data (worth $196 million) which everyone should be familiar with – they need to know who you are, where you live, and what you like, to make effective advertisements and get you to buy more stuff!
What is your data worth?
This dense cloud of personal data that we generate over our lifetimes is worth surprisingly little. According to a 2015 study by Western Digital, a data storage company, 5,000 consumers valued their data on average at £3,241 (that’s $4,165.33 today).
Those 5,000 consumers would be crushed to know that all together their personal data would be worth about $2.50. According to a Financial Times report in 2013, 1,000 people’s personal data collectively costs $0.50, and an individual’s age, gender, and location is worth only approximately $0.0005 per person.
For more specific information, such as the names of people who suffer from a particular disease, an individual name could cost up to $0.30.
Of course wherever a legitimate market exists, there is also a black market, and the value of data such as health records, identification, and credit card info on the dark web is much higher.
Login and password data for premium content services, such as Netflix, is worth about as much as a whole person’s personal data on the open market: $0.55 (and who hasn’t given away that information for free at least once?)
Stolen credit or debit card numbers fetch $20-35, which seems small for the amount of havoc one could wreak with that information. Health records on the dark web can go for $50 apiece and online banking login information depends on how much money is in your account, but can retail between $190-$1,000.00.

Can you sell your data yourself?
Obviously most people won’t ruin their own lives by selling their own credit card or banking info on the dark web, but a service does already exist to allow you to personally profit off of legal data sales.
Datacoup is the “world’s first personal data marketplace,” which will help you collect and sell your data for cash.



According to several sources, you can earn about $8 per month selling your personal data via Datacoup, and currently the service is only available in the US. You must install certain applications to allow Datacoup to monitor and collect this data, which people who are already trying to gain control over their personal data may be averse to.
There are also two notable examples of individuals who have taken a more radical approach to selling their own personal data: a Dutch student named Shawn Buckles, and a Brooklyn-based engineer named Federico Zannier.
From May 6th to June 5th of 2013, Zannier opened a Kickstarter called “A bite of Me” with a goal of $500, to sell a painstakingly collected arrangement of personal data.
He states on the Kickstarter’s campaign page:

“Since February, I have been recording all of my online activity (the HTML pages I have visited, the position of the mouse pointer, a screenshot of what I was looking at, a webcam image of me looking at my computer, my GPS location and a log of the apps that I was using)... I'm selling this data for $2 a day. If more people do the same, I'm thinking marketers could just pay us directly for our data. It might sound crazy, but so is giving all our data away for free.”



Geolocation data visualization by Federico Zannier via Kickstarter

For $2, backers would receive one day’s worth of this data; $25 for a week of his data and access to his custom tools to collect and analyze their own data – and for a pledge of $200 or more, access to the entire data archive, 7GB of information including:

“50,000 files, which include some 2,800 websites I visited; 20,500 screen shots; 17,000 webcam images; a recording of my mouse pointer movements; my GPS location; an application log of 23,000 lines of text; an iPhone app and a Chrome Extension for tracking your own activity; a suite of tools for analyzing the data (which includes 50 bash, python and R scripts).”

He got 213 backers who pledged $2,733 in total, and has not supplied any further updates on his personal website http://federicozannier.com (which now belongs to a Japanese SIM card marketing company) or http://myprivacy.info – a now-defunct site that previously hosted visualizations of his personal data.

Over $2,000 is not a bad take compared to Shawn Buckles’ profit: he set up a “Data for sale” website with an online auctioning system to sell his personal data in April of 2014.
Tech publication The Next Web was the highest bidder and paid him €350 for his personal profile, location records, train records, personal calendar, email conversations,  online conversations, thoughts, consumer preferences, and browsing history.



The Next Web planned to use his data to illustrate the issue of privacy at their 2014 The Next Web Conference, and Buckles donated the profit for “selling his data soul” to Bits For Freedom, a Dutch digital rights association. All of it seems like a noble demonstration, but since he included information such as email and online conversations with others, he has admitted the project lost him some friendships.
Buckles also released a pamphlet on digital privacy containing some food for thought, as we contemplate what it means to create, monetize, and define ourselves by our data:

“Privacy is the right to live unobserved and undisturbed, and to decide for oneself what information one shares and with whom. Privacy is based upon a personal enviroment [sic] in which we can seclude ourselves. Privacy is essential in shaping one's identity.


“But privacy is gone. We gave it up, for no other reason but the thought that it's useless. Why don't we protect our rights? Our ancestors fought fiercely for them -because they were oppressed.


“‘I've got nothing to hide’


"This is a fallacy. What will happen if a Hitler takes power tomorrow? Nobody'd be safe. He wouldn't only know our location, networks and believes, also he could pretty accurately predict our behavioural patterns and our patterns of resistance. To flee or hide would be impossible. We'd be powerless. Whether we have something to hide is defined by the context in which we live.


Their [sic] will come a day we need the right to privacy. Maybe that day's today. Are we free? Do we live in peace?
That depends on who you regard as your friend. And more importantely [sic]: how your friends regard you.”


While we live in a society where we are constantly interconnected by technology, our personal data choices also impact those around us.
It seems ironic that part of Buckles’ privacy manifesto warns against the imprisonment of technology and links to Edward Snowden’s TED talk on “How we take back the internet”, while espousing the dangers of governmental control of our personal data - but through this project he has not only participated in his own self-commodification, but involved unwilling participants as well.

Where the personal meets the political in the monetization of data seems to be an always shifting line, and the old adage of “if you can’t beam ‘em, join ‘em” rings hollow but true in both Buckles and Zannier’s examples.
As people gain more awareness of what data is being constantly collected about them, hopefully we move towards a future in which people are more empowered and enriched (in knowledge and capital) by their personal data than enslaved by the combination of technology and global capitalism that produces this increasingly profitable market.

In Part Two, we’ll explore other human byproducts that you can sell yourself in the future today: from bodily fluids that are normally disposed of to your personal genetic code – and a woman who incorporated her entire existence.

IN EPISODE 12's Today's Dystopia movie special, we dig into two sci-fi "classics":• They Live - With each year that passes since its 1988 release, John Carpenter’s Horror-Sci-Fi B-movie classic They Live reveals itself more and more to be a stiletto-sharp appraisal of the consumerism, capitalism, and inequality that saturates society – and how it is slowly, silently strangling us, right under our noses. Joe dons the famous sunglasses to find out how much They Live! is like we, live.• Equilibrium - In the unintentionally amusing 2002 sci-fi extravaganza, Art and emotions are illegal in the city of Libria, and a young-ish Christian Bale struggles with his emotions, his fight to expose the truth, and his ability to keep a straight face. How close are we to this forecast fascist future?

THE PAST INSIDE THE PRESENT: In this MONTAG series we ask: how new is our newest technology - and how old are the ideas we're excited by today?
As a society, we've always been using the latest technology to cling onto loved ones that we've lost. Whether it's death-masks or post-death family portraits, what's clear that letting go is incredibly hard. So, how will this obsession point to how we'll deal with death in the future - when we can recreate dead people in VR?


One remarkable consequence of technology evolving at an exponential rate is that we’re able to dig into our innermost desires and confidently predict that they’ll be fulfilled within a few years without sounding like a lunatic.
A lot of future-gazing becomes a string of simple questions which mask the fact that we’re strolling into a vast moral maze. These questions are ones we have been internally haggling over for as long as we’ve been able to: how do we deal with the randomness of life, death, and everything in between – things we want, but can’t control?
So here’s a question that will test your moral fortitude: if you could bring a loved one back to life, would you do it?
A soul with a body, not a body with a soul.
We cling to our physical selves for dear life - literally. It doesn’t really matter who said it first - a forgotten Church of England Reverend, author C.S. Lewis or, erm, best-selling self-help author Wayne Dyer  - as humans we’ve always struggled with the idea of being “a soul that happens to have a body, not a body with a soul.”
Whether it’s prioritising physical well-being over mental, endlessly scouring for new wonder-diets, or stating explicitly that one’s aim is to live forever, whenever we look to maintain life, we look to the physical world.

The weird ways we have kept alive memories of the dead points at us being ill-equipped to deal with the brutal reality of death.

We don't only kept hold of items that belonged to dead friends and relatives as mementoes - our society has also shown a frankly odd and macabre propensity for preserving things that look just like dead people.
Depending on your perspective, the weird ways we have kept alive memories of the dead points at us being ill-equipped - or hopelessly unable - to deal with the brutal reality of death.

Death Mask Replica
Only 40 per cent of children born in the 1850s reached their 60th birthday, making death, as well as life, a state to be preserved for posterity.
Death masks are odd: a teenage goth’s take on Madame Tussaud’s. And while to our modern minds capturing a likeness of a face just after the moment of expiration might beg the question, “hey - why not just take the impression of the mask when the subject is alive?” it does point at a rather more blasé – and possibly more healthy – approach to death, from an era when people experienced death much more often.

The Victorians, naturally, found an ideal balance between their penchant for pioneering innovative technology and their deep-rooted preoccupation with death.

The idea of a death mask was to revisit a person and reflect on more than loss. A perfect brass copy of Napoleon’s face, for instance, is part of a collection of items that explain the whole cycle of his life, not simply a last-ditch attempt at recording his likeness forever.
Some death masks were cast multiple times; one became a fashionable wall decoration among the early 20th Century Parisian art set.

The Victorians, naturally, found an ideal balance between their penchant for pioneering innovative technology and their deep-rooted preoccupation with death. Quickly taking advantage of new photographic technology, they invented the Memento Mori photo: a family snap with a difference.
Rounding up the family and leaning in around a corpse meant that the Memento Mori was half celebration of life, and half stern reminder of the unavoidable nature of death.
It was the perfect buzzkill-keepsake for our moustachioed and crinoline-swathed forbearers, who followed the gloomy example of Queen Victoria, in the midst of spending her final forty years wearing black and mourning the loss of her beloved husband, cousin, and alleged genital piercing enthusiast, Prince Albert.
It also turned out that the dead were ideal portrait subjects in an era of long exposures where the slightest movement could spoilt a snapshot. Consider the irony of the utter, inherent stillness of your death providing the most conveniently clear image of you, that you’d never see.
Snapping selfies with corpses aside, is our behaviour today really much different? Are you wearing a dead relative’s piece of jewellery right now? Do you have a dusty VHS – that you couldn’t even consider playing without a trip to a fleamarket – tucked away somewhere safe, because it’s the only imagery you have of Auntie Vera?
Are you keeping love letters, just in case the sender dies before you?

An augmented family

If you’d like a dead relative to accompany your every step in life, you’ll be able to have them do just that.

Like the Victorians, we’re living in a time of rapid technological development. And if the wish-fulfilment they sought was to be able to occasionally gaze at the face of someone who had died, then our generation's equivalent is going to be a little more… involved.
While it's difficult to overstate the significance of the coming Augmented Reality revolution, it's also easy to get distracted by banality. AR won’t just mean email notifications popping up into your field of vision (although it will mean that too – get used to never escaping your workaholic boss) – eventually, AR means experiencing the world in the exact way you’d prefer it to be.
And if you’d prefer to have a dead relative appear to accompany you every step of the way, you’ll be able to have them do just that.
This is the uncanny power of AR: scoff at this idea if you like – but people want it, so it’s coming. It will soon be time to make a tough but important decision: will you let the dead-and-gone remain dead and gone?
Big technological leaps often sound like bullshit, or crazy, or too complicated, or all three. But this stroll through the four stages of Future Grief takes a trivial series of steps. Here’s how this future could creep in under your nose.
Step 1: Now, Part 1: Scan yourself. Scan everyone.
We’re already keeping avatars of loved ones. In the UK, you can pull on your flashiest clothes, drive to a supermarket, step into a scanning booth – and wait for the delivery of a 15cm-tall 3D-printed model of yourself.
You might think of it as a fun gimmick or use it as an ironically self-referential paperweight. But when you kick the can, do you think your relatives might fetishise it as an enhanced snapshot of the real you, warts and all? The wonky posture, the dated clothes, the regrettable hairdo - this lump of 3d-printed plastic is a tangible echo of you, and it can fit in a handbag.
Step 2: Now, Part 2: Your home videos, in volumetric 3D.
You can already record a person as a volumetric 3D model. If you have enough GoPros (53, to be exact), you can do it yourself at home. Sync it with some audio (Why not tell the story of your life? Yours is as good as anyone’s, right?) and your great-great-great grandchildren will be able to load you up into their AR headsets. When they’ve stopped giggling at the rudimentary nature of the graphics, they’ll experience what it was like to have you right there in front of them.

Step 3: Five years’ time: You are the augmentation.
You might not be able to meet these great-great-great sniggering whippersnappers, but they can meet you. And that's the dream of Augmented Memento Mori: everlasting life. Within a few years, processing power and believable, immersive AR delivery via glasses will converge and it’ll be possible that not only will a 3D model of you appear in front of the user, but it will be context-aware.
This means that in the future, when your descendants gather at Christmas and fancy hearing your stories one more time, they’ll load "you" up — and you’ll appear to walk through a door, sit down next to the fireplace and share the anecdotes with the family you never met.
Step 4: 10-15 years’ time: Uncle Dave, life guide
When we are all wearing AR headsets as a matter of course, the 3D model of you will become an avatar; a real-life video game character. You don’t even need to record your movements or voice specifically. Adobe has already created the technology needed to make “you” say anything anyone else wants.
You’ll be an AI-powered avatar for the family member who misses you the most – not dissimilar to Navi in The Ocarina of Time, just less annoying. The technology will combine all the data we need: calendars, maps, wikis, etc, then filter it through AI, and create a "you" that is infinitely knowledgable, and yet still identifiably you.
Thus, your new life after death will be as a helpful guide: hinting, pointing, encouraging, reminiscing, defending, and urging someone who really needs you there.

You'll live forever (for someone else)
Similar to how your best chance of a having a perfect photo taken in 1849 would involve you being well and truly dead, the ultimate irony of the AR Memento Mori is that we won’t benefit from it at all. Life after death doesn't involve the deceased after all. It’s all for the living.
For someone who loves you and misses you, your avatar will be an essential part of the grieving process. And just like how corpses were dressed, arranged and posed for photographs, these avatars will be filtered through the expectations of others.
Short tempers will be whittled down, questionable jokes swapped for good ones, a tendency to drink too much at family parties subtly erased.
You'll become the person they need, not the person you are; ready to guide and support whenever they need you. It’s a wonderful idea. Of course some people won’t ever be able to let you go – and would you really want them too?

In an era when we carry iPhones and smartphones designed to connect anyone with anyone else, or reveal any information instantly, it's weird to consider that there could be people or communities that don't want to be found at all.
But as MONTAG's Kathryn Lawrence explains, there is still a thriving weird online world of hidden subcultures that allow anyone to feel united – whilst being utterly private.

It seems like every week a different previously unheard-of subculture is thrust into the spotlight and made spectacle of by internet journalists for the general public.
Whether it’s the furry alt-right, present-day Tamagotchi enthusiasts, or your run-of-the-mill deep web cybercriminal communities, groups that gather on forums to discuss very niche content have become the freaks of the week.
In our current era of constant surveillance and interconnection, where nothing online is truly private, can the internet still be a safe place for odd people to find each other and create fringe communities? Where will we go when the fringe becomes the mainstream, if it hasn’t already?

The internet has always been a place for lonely people with strange interests to find each other.

via GIPHY

In the 80s and 90s, home computer users were a fringe group altogether and the small communities that gathered around shared interests like computers and file sharing communicated via bulletin boards hosted on dial-up networks.

In 2005, a thread entitled "i am lonely will anyone speak to me" became the first hit for people who entered “I am lonely” into Google

Then came email-based newsgroups and IRC channels, which allowed for real-time communication, followed by the earliest internet forums. Throughout the 90s and past the Y2K, millions of internet forums have gathered likeminded groups – professional pilots, fan fiction writers, expecting parents, and amateur film critics – every possible category of interest has its own forums.
In 2005, a thread entitled "i am lonely will anyone speak to me" on a forum for questions about digital media encoding, became the first hit for people who entered “I am lonely” into Google due to the webmaster’s SEO skills. Internet psychologist Mark Griffiths was quoted in one article about the bizarre popularity of the forum, *“There are a lot of lonely people out there… but creating a kinship with like-minded people can help. You're all in this virtual space together."*
In today’s internet climate, where having at least one social media profile is practically mandatory to participate in society, some users look for even more anonymity in their online social spaces.

"We are Anonymous, We are legion"
I am not the first to see the ubiquity of social media and the increase in popularity of 4chan as directly related.
On 4chan, all posts are both anonymous and ephemeral. The effect of this anonymity and ephemerality on what the board produces has been studied and correlated with an “online disinhibition effect,” the racist, sexist, homophobic, and other undesirable rhetorical results of which have subjected the users of 4chan’s /b/ and /pol/ messageboards to rigorous public scrutiny.
However, online disinhibition is also what allows a user to type “I am lonely,” into Google, or participate in the discussions of their niche interests that grew internet forums on every topic imaginable.

What we see as a circus or a freak show they call refreshingly honest and, paradoxically, more genuine for its lack of sincerity.

Attempts to decode the belief in meme magic and the cult of Kek that rationalize the behavior of this most extreme online community give us a window not only into a freak show of the week, but also reflect the motivation behind the movement of fringe internet subcultures in general into the mainstream.
It’s the same reason that people are pulled into this subculture: they call what we see as a circus or a freak show refreshingly honest and, paradoxically, more genuine for its lack of sincerity.
This week’s freak show is the next week’s old news, and according to the 1% rule, the number of people who “lurk” invisibly in these spaces is significantly higher than the visible contributors.
The 1% Rule states that, on average, 1% of a group creates content, 10% comments or actively participates, and 90% of the users simply observe and absorb information. This implicates many, many more people in participating in these outsider communities by observing them – almost so many that they are no longer "outside."


The 1% Rule via Virtual Learning Network


Private but public; alone but together
So where does that leave us, if the entire internet is one large interconnected fringe – and every niche interest, even the antisocial communities, become part of the mainstream? Where can we go for our subcultural kicks, if we want to observe, or if we want to participate, for a safe space to express ourselves however we wish?
The dark web, an internet that is accessible only by a special configuration of networks, went mainstream in 2013 when Robert Ulrich, known online as The Dread Pirate Roberts, was apprehended by the FBI and subsequently given a life sentence for creating and maintaining a marketplace known as the Silk Road on the dark web.

Public perception of using encrypted networks is changing, due to the same political and cultural climate that drives the fringe into the mainstream

The publicity around this case formed much of the public’s knowledge about the dark web, that it was a place used only for drug deals, child pornography, arms dealing, and fraud, among other cybercrimes.

However, public perception of using encrypted networks is changing, due to the same political and cultural climate that spurs the growth of 4chan and drives the fringe into the mainstream.
More internet users are now aware of how much their personal data is being used against them, and seek places where what they do won’t be sold to advertisers, which rules out the most popular social media platforms and search engines, and thanks to a recent bill in the US, even your internet service provider can sell your browsing history.
New users of the dark web are doing so for personal privacy reasons, not piracy reasons. Aren’t you sick of targeted advertising following you everywhere? Do you want to escape your filter bubble of mainstream news outlets and distorted search results?
In the pursuit of community, anonymity, and freedom of expression, expect more internet users to go to the dark side. We’re all in this virtual space together – and no one wants to be the freak of the week.

For most of us, microtransactions are a necessary evil. That is, if your definition of a necessity includes extra lives in Candy Crush, which have officially been included in Maslow's (Revised) Hierarchy of Needs for the 21st century.
It's something of a cliché at this point, when writing about technology designed to exploit our addictive tendencies, to reference Candy Crush, and the conversation about the growing overuse of microtransactions in games seems to have peaked a few years ago. A conservative estimate of the size of the In-App Purchase economy in 2013 based solely on revenue from Apple's App Store was six billion dollars.
Both the game guru of King (creators of Candy Crush Saga) and the Vice President of EA Games predicted in the early 2010s that by this time, most if not all games would be free-to-play or include microtransactions somewhow in their business model. And they seem to have been correct.
Microtransactions have not only fully infected the gaming world from free-to-play to AAA games, but have become enmeshed in the fabric of our daily lives, as gamification and psychological manipulation of users by tech in every aspect – from getting our news on social media to our dating apps – has continued growing insidiously apace.
First, let's explore how advanced these psychological manipulation techniques have become, and then how they will affect other parts of our daily lives in the future.

Defining microtransactions
In hilarious meta fashion the TV Tropes page for microtransactions implements a fake paywall in the article defining them with a link that says, "You need more TV Tropesbucks to see the rest of this trope's definition. Please enter your credit card details to continue," and goes to their "Self-Demonstrating Article" page. This is followed by buttons that say "Click here to reveal the second paragraph. You will be billed US$0.99."
I have clicked to reveal all five paragraphs and have yet to be billed, but you can never be too careful – heed the story of a Belgian teen who spent $46,000 on a mobile game.
The definition of a microtransaction is as follows:

"Microtransactions, also called Micropayments or MTX, are small transactions found in online games and services where a user pays a one-time fee for access to a piece of exclusive content (Virtual Goods)."

This definition is particularly useful because while many of the examples of the psychological tricks that are used to encourage micropayments are from video games, the same techniques are used to encourage spending outside of the PC and mobile gaming world for all types of virtual and non-virtual goods.
How microtransactions work

via GIPHY

If you've ever been close to a human, or human behavior, you may have noticed two little characters hanging around them: Little Shoulder Angel and Little Shoulder Devil (terms not yet recognized in the psychological literature). These two help us make all of our decisions; not our rational minds, not our emotions, but a constant war over our mortal souls.
Let's say the Little Shoulder Angel represents our best tendencies: towards enrichment of the self and others, peace, and happiness. Little Shoulder Devil, well, you know what it wants, and you can probably guess which one of them whispers that you should spend real-world money on intangible video game items.
Here's a quick breakdown of the many tricks that the Little Shoulder Devil (with some help from game developers) uses to trigger microtransactions:


Freemium content, also known as the foot-in-the-door method: this is the "first one is always free" approach to creating addicted customers. You get something for no cost first, and if you like it, there's more enticement to pay. "Freemium," the combination of free and paid (premium) services, was predicted as a business model of the future in 2009 by Chris Anderson in a book called "Free: The Future of a Radical Price".


Related to Freemium is the concept of reciprocity, which may have more to do with Little Shoulder Angel: if you are provided with something you like, you are willing to pay for it, even if it was free in the first place.


The Endowment Effect is the idea that when you own something, you value it more than before you buy it, and even value it more than if you were selling it (based on this study from 1990).


Reward Removal relies on the Endowment Effect, by giving you something (thereby raising its personal value to you) and then threatening to take it away. For example, if you can't beat the boss in the dungeon you may lose all your dungeon progress, and the Little Shoulder Devil says you better buy some extra in-game items to make sure you beat it. Another tactic is to give a player items they can't keep in their inventory unless they pay to expand it – the expansion seems so much more necessary because the item feels like it's already owned and therefore more valuable.


Ego Depletion is the fancy name for getting bugged over and over to buy things. Eventually, your decision-making system gets tired and Little Shoulder Devil's whispers get louder than your rational mind. There are even microtransactions called "pay once and play," in which you can pay one microtransaction for the assurance that you will not be offered any more microtransactions.


Price Shrouding is the obfuscation of your actual currency's value into the currency system of a game. According to one study of in-game currencies from Gamesparks, up to four different currencies is the current standard for a single game, with at least one Premium currency that can only be bought with real money. You have to use your real money to buy Game Gold, and use Game Gold to buy Shiny Fancy Items, and maybe even can sell Shiny Fancy Items within a game's auction house or stores to get Rubies, which are used to buy Different Shiny Fancy Items. By the time you're trading your Rubies, it's almost impossible to tell how much real money they were worth. Bulk discounts on these in-game currencies also abstract their value in real-world currencies.


Pay or Wait, also known as Illusory Discomfort or "fun pain" (this last term coined by a developer while working for Zynga) is the temptation for instant gratification. Of course there are (usually) mechanics within games (like waiting time or grinding) that will get you the reward you seek via the virtuous path of patience or skill espoused by Little Shoulder Angel, but Little Shoulder Devil lets you know you can also have it NOW NOW NOW! for the low low price of actual money.


Sunk Costs is the fancy economics term for throwing good money after bad (though it's really all bad money). Little Shoulder Angel says, "You've already spent $20 on Clash of Clans, maybe it's best to stop," and Little Shoulder Devil says, "If you spend $30 more maybe you'll win enough to feel better about spending $50!"


Variable Rate Enforcement is one of the reasons loot boxes have become an incredibly profitable form of mictrotransactions: you never know what you're going to get. Getting different rewards in each box activates your dopamine system more than knowing exactly what kind of reward you're going to get at any time (the same method that makes you play slot machines and other gambling games of chance).


Benign Envy: according to the study The Hidden Cost of Microtransactions: Buying In-Game Advantages in Online Games Decreases a Player’s Status, published in the international Journal of Internet Science in 2015, researchers studying the games Maple Story, Diablo III, and World of Tanks found three results from players buying in-game boosts, using real money in auction houses, and paying for better tanks in the three games respectively. Their first finding was lost respect for pay-to-players, the second was ill will towards them, and schadenfreude motivating other players to root against them. And the third effect was temptation for non-paying players to buy things themselves – even though they lost respect for and resented those other players who paid.


In 2015, Activision filed for a patent on certain technologies that were supposed to increase the likelihood of players using microtransactions, which was just approved this year (as reported by Glixel), although they deny implementing any of the patented features. One feature is designed to induce exactly this kind of envy by matching high-performing players who have just bought new items with players who haven't and are lower skill levels. The idea being that the player who loses will think it's because they did not buy the cool items their opponents have. Another feature was designed to place users who have recently purchased items in scenarios where those items would be beneficial, enhancing the Endowment Effect and perceived value of the item.
But maybe at this point you're saying, "Wow, it's a good thing I don't play any video games, those are for suckers!" Sad to say, we are all suckers in late capitalism, and you can't escape microtransactions anywhere.
Micropayments IRL

via GIPHY

The subscription model, which predated the microtransaction model in video games (one source cites the launch of World of Warcraft as a subscription in November of 2004 as the beginning of the end for how we pay for games) is creeping its way into every facet of life, and for some things (like consumer electronics that you may want to use for say, only three months at a time) it's an excellent alternative to ownership.
For others, like a subscription box for monthly anal toy delivery (it was called Butt Box) or a monthly subscription to beer koozies (full review of the Can Pants subscription box here), what you are really subscribing to is a constant barrage of microtransactions for frivolity, instant gratification, or features that seem like they should be in the full version of paid services.
In the realm of entertainment, the ads on most streaming services function effectively as microtransactions, as you give 20 or 30 seconds of your time in exchange for your video fix. Who hasn't been tempted to buy a subscription to Hulu Plus for $5.99 after seeing the same ad 500 times?
Maybe you're saying "Thank goodness I don't indulge in streaming video, and only play card games on my PC" In which case, weird, but you still can't escape them. Even Solitaire on Windows 10 requires $1.49 per month or $10 per year to not show ads.
You can buy microtransactions to enhance your dating life with Tinder Gold, which for $4.99 per month, amongst other features, lets you browse the people who have already swiped right on you – eliminating some of the dopamine-squirting joy of not knowing whether you matched with someone as you go, but providing an incredible boost for the ego to see your potential paramours all laid out and waiting for you to message them.
Plus, microtransactions have already started being implemented in the more quotidian parts of life, like waiting for customer service on the phone. In 2014, the UK's biggest 4G mobile network, EE, added the option of a 50 cent charge to skip to the front of the customer service phone queue.
Micropayments of the future

Hopefully they will engage Little Shoulder Angel and Little Shoulder Devil in equal measure

Cryptocurrencies (you didn't think a single feature in this issue wouldn't contain a reference to cryptocurrencies, did you?) have been speculated to be the future of micropayments, once they are stable enough to be used by more of the population in daily life. Blockchain advocates have speculated that cryptocurrency micropayments could even be the future of journalism: instead of implementing a subscription model, as several news outlets currently do, they would charge a fraction of a fraction of a bitcoin per article.
Almost everything entertainment-related in the future could be based on something like the Patreon model - you can pay a creator $1 every time they release something, as a microtransaction for art.
Or, in the worst case, we end up like the Black Mirror episode Fifteen Million Merits, in which all currency is transferred into a gamified, almost impossible to accumulate system that keeps people literally running on hamster wheels and is sapped away slowly but consistently for every aspect of life.

via GIPHY

The most likely outcome, of course, is something in the middle. More of our lives will involve microtransactions to make them easier, and many of them will be annoying, but hopefully they will engage Little Shoulder Angel and Little Shoulder Devil in equal measure.
As our last prediction, we're with Twitter user @Papapishu, who is betting on Philip K. Dick being right again, "and smart locks end up having microtransactions like in Ubik." What follows is the excerpt of text from Dick's Ubik that accompanied this Tweet, a vision of our microtransactional future from a master of speculation:
The door refused to open. It said, "Five cents, please."
He searched his pockets. No more coins; nothing. "I'll pay you tomorrow," he told the door. Again he tried the knob. Again it remained locked tight. "What I pay you," he informed it, "is in the nature of a gratuity; I don't have to pay you."
"I think otherwise," the door said. "Look in the purchase contract you signed when you bought this conapt."
In his desk drawer he found the contract; since signing it he had found it necessary to refer to the document many times. Sure enough; payment to his door for opening and shutting constituted a mandatory fee. Not a tip.
"You discover I'm right," the door said. It sounded smug.
From the drawer beside the sink Joe Chip got a stainless steel knife; with it he began systematically to unscrew the bolt assembly of his apt's money-gulping door.
"I'll sue you," the door said as the first screw fell out.

In Part 1 of this short series exploring the limits of communication, Sean Fleming explored how our smartest technology copes with delivering all the nuances of human communication. (SPOILER: it's not very good at it.)
Now, in Part 2, he explores how these limitations cut both ways: how do the fleshy meat-bags that are our human bodies cope when we use Virtual Reality technology to communicate with others in ways that have never been experienced in all of human history? What happens when we are not even seeing our own life through our own eyes any more?

Immersive communication means that you feel like you're really there. And that's where it gets tricky.
Mark Farid is an artist. He wants to test the limits of how humans experience life, and Mark's got a plan: he intends to lock himself in a room, wearing an Oculus Rift headset the whole time.
He’ll experience life “through the eyes” of a series of other human beings who – via some advanced Google Glass-like equipment – will stream everything they see, hear and do into Mark’s eyes and ears.
For a month.
The project website is here if you’re intrigued (and, frankly, you bloody should be.)

When you communicate in an immersive virtual environment, what does the “self” even mean?

Of the many intriguing parts of Mark’s scheme, one stands out. When VICE spoke to behavioural psychologists about his plan, they expressed concern for Mark’s wellbeing:
“...his behaviors—the way these thoughts manifest—are bound to be affected, and Mark will be forever changed by this, the same way we're all changed by our experiences.”
So it’s entirely possible that a future where simple, but continual, interfacing with other people through VR will change who we are and how act. It's just about recognisable as communication, but a lot more involved.
Mark’s is an extreme example, granted, yet it’s still highly instructive: when you communicate in an immersive virtual environment, what does the “self” even mean?

Despite the excitement and hype around VR/AR, digital communication will never push real-world interaction into total obsolescence.
As artist Mark points out: as we’ve grown up with technology, we’ve assumed that technology has grown up too. Maybe it simply isn’t able to.
Neither the telephone, nor fax, nor email could slake our thirst for in-person communication. In the early 90s, dot-com-fever-pitch tech “mavens” passionately predicted that cities would become spooky ghost-versions of their former selves, as the internet did away with cafés and offices.
And now, just look: with their tech dream in full bloom, we ironically occupy these once-social spaces with our laptops; to sip herbal teas as slowly as possible whilst we steal WiFi and connect with others, elsewhere.
So, we’re still physically hankering for real human connection, even if it’s just for someone to bring us a quinoa brownie while we post gifs on WhatsApp. We haven’t even fully adjusted to the limitations of our current communication channels yet.
But the line is going to keep getting blurrier, and in the meantime, we need to tell the difference between the extremes, as well as how to deal with the human bit in the middle.
We’re going to need old-fashioned, flesh-and-blood judgement.

Onward into an uncertain future of virtual chatter we go, then.
As end-users, we are the market, and have a say in what sort of experience we have when digital and synthetic communications combine seamlessly with what we now call “reality”.
At this point I’m reminded of David Foster Wallace’s unforgettable account of the rise and fall of the videophone in his masterpiece, Infinite Jest.

“Video telephony rendered the fantasy insupportable. Callers now found they had to compose the same sort of earnest, slightly overintense listener's expression they had to compose for in-person exchanges. Those callers who out of unconscious habit succumbed to fuguelike doodling or pants-crease-adjustment now came off looking extra rude, absentminded, or childishly self-absorbed. Callers who even more unconsciously blemish-scanned or nostril explored looked up to find horrified expressions on the video-faces at the other end. All of which resulted in videophonic stress.”

But that's fiction. It’s not like we’re obsessively concerned with exquisitely curating our digital selves, right? Between Instagram filters and wearing extra makeup, we clearly want to our representations, virtual or otherwise, to be flattering. To be... not us.

As digital citizens, we do not want to replicate our offline lives online.
We already have offline lives. Millions of years of evolution has made us fucking great at real interactions. And so this is where Augmented Reality offers a third, new, way.
Forget VR and AR headsets and powerful laptops – it’s here now. The appeal of Snapchat is not in replicating existing interaction, but the layers of unreality you can stick onto your – let’s be honest – boring selfie.
The appeal of AR is additive: it’s there in all of the wacky shit we can pin onto our lives. Gamify your morning commute. Record life stats. Stick puppy gifs onto boring buildings.
Welcome to Life Plus. Communicate wisely, friends.

As for me, my only digital life-augmentation thus far is a T-shirt with the Welsh flag on it that I purchased years ago for my now-retired Xbox Live avatar. Hey, I wonder what he’s up to nowadays? I should send him a DM.

They say you should dress for the job you want, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to figure out what exactly those job options will be in the future.  Recently, the MIT Technology Review published a table of every study they could find on what automation will do to future jobs, and the predictions range from 2 billion jobs destroyed worldwide by 2030, to 890 million jobs created.
So while even the experts disagree about what the future of work entails, what you wear to work in the future will still depend on what kind of job you have, with wearable tech options ranging from high-tech business suits and to super-powered exo-suits.
The January 2018 Market Research Report on Workwear trends by Global Industry Analysts, Inc., stands at 418 pages, profiles 119 companies, and costs $5,000 to read. That's a small price to pay for a five-year historic analysis of general workwear, corporate workwear, and uniforms, as well as annual estimates and forecasts for 2016 through 2024.
But looking at the abstract and contents is free, and allows us to glean such insights as "Functional and Durable Clothing Offering a Safe Niche in an Otherwise Troubled Apparel Industry" and "Women: A Major Consumer Category." Who knew?
The "Noteworthy design and color trends in workwear" section includes subchapters on both "grey shades" (at least 50 of them, hopefully) and "neutrals and bright colors," which really narrows it down. "Embellished Aprons" also have their own entire subchapter, so fashionistas please take note, this is your style inspo for S/S 2024:



There are much more futuristic-sounding trends listed as well in the chapter entitled "Innovations & Advancements," including nanotechnology, emergence of "E-Textiles," and an encouragingly vague material called "Flex 2000" which personally I can't wait to apply to my body. Until MONTAG has the budget to acquire a $5,000.00 market research report for fun, or (more likely) this tech hits the high-performance apparel industries and trickles down to consumer goods, we'll have to wait to find out.

According to the same market research report (which again, it has to be noted, we haven't actually read), millennials are driving growth in demand for casual workwear by blurring the lines between work, home, rest, and travel clothes. At least in the tech and startup industries, this is undoubtedly true: you can add office dress code staples like pressed pants, button-ups, collared shirts and pantyhose to the list of things millennials are killing. And like anything that millennials do just because it's easy or feels good, there is an accompanying outsized moral panic with headlines like "What's the problem with millennials in the workplace?", "The End Of The Office Dress Code", "Sorry, Clothing Retailers: Millennials Would Rather Save For Travel", and "Is Casual Dress Killing Your Productivity At Work?"
Of course this isn't true in every industry, and the higher on the corporate ladder you climb the more likely it is you'll have to shape up and suit up, but Silicon Valley has been leading the way for some of the richest people on earth to dress like they're beat poets on top, dad jeans on the bottom (Steve Jobs' famous uniform), still rolling out of a dorm room single bed (a la Zuck), or about to go hiking in a sleeveless vest (a signature look from the Bezos collection).
Even businesses that emphasize the business side of business casual are getting comfortable (but on the DL). Companies like Carbon38 and Dai are creating chic separates for the skirt suit set out of the same materials as yoga pants and running gear. San Francisco's crowdfunded clothing company Betabrand even has an entire line of pants that are secretly as good for downward dog as presenting PowerPoints. Joanna Dai of the eponymous fashion brand explained her inspiration and reflects on her experiences in banking for Fast Company, "Having worked in an industry where the dress code is still alive and well, I know there’s still a demand for suits and shift dresses. Women in law, politics, and finance aren’t wearing sneakers to the office just yet."
Just as athleisure shows no signs of stopping or even slowing down as a trend for casual fashion, activewear is slowly but surely making its way into an office near you.
Suits and Exo-Suits
For those who don't work in an office, the future is going to be a lot cooler than secret yoga pants. Although the auto industry is one of the places hit hardest by automation, Ford is one of the first companies to robotically support its human workers by providing exoskeleton vests to its manufacturing plants in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.
These vests are a product by Ekso Bionics, a company that makes robotic assistance technologies for medical as well as manufacturing applications. They received the first FDA clearance for technology to assist in stroke and spinal cord injury rehabilitation, and had a trial period with Ford last year at two of its factories in Michigan which saw an 83% decrease in the number of incidents resulting in worker injury, and a 90% decrease in ergonomic stress injuries like overextension.
The EksoVests deployed in the Ford plants are worn on workers' backs, and provide 5 to 15 pounds of additional support per arm for overhead movements and lifting heavy items, and there are other models like the EksoZeroG that ease the physical burden on construction and electrical workers by supporting different muscles. A member of the Reno Carpenters Union testifies on the EksoWorks site: "Before, carpenters could get between 50 and 100 holes in a day by switching guys out, because it is just brutal… Now with Peggy Sue [EksoZeroG], on a good day, I can do 300 to 330 holes—one guy by himself."



Super strength and endurance isn't even the limit of exoskeleton technology: couldn't you sometimes use an extra pair of hands? A prototype called Fusion, developed by Yamen Saraji, an assistant professor at Tokyo's Keio University Graduate School of Media Design, is a lightweight, VR-controlled set of robot arms that you can wear on your back.



The first project by the same team, MetaLimbs, had a similar design but the extra arms were controlled by the wearer's feet:



The arms of Fusion are controlled by someone else wearing a VR headset, which sees the view from a camera mounted right over the wearer's shoulder. While it's not quite ready for mass production, weighing in at 21 pounds and with only 1.5 hours of battery life, Saraji's team has pitched it to a Tokyo startup accelerator, and you can imagine all of its potential applications in an industrial context. MIT research scientist Hermano Igo Krebs was quoted speculating that it could be used by astronauts or paramedics, particularly if they need help with unfamiliar procedures; having an expert control a second set of hands in a medical emergency would be invaluable.
And who knows, although the Google Glass crashed and burned on its first attempt to break through the wearable tech ceiling, wearable personal robotics could become the norm. Who couldn't use an extra pair of arms for housework like cooking or cleaning? And forget about constantly picking up and putting down your cell phone: although we joked about it in MONTAG'S Komfort Future Technologies, there's already a gadget for that too (automatical scrolling, swiping, and liking features not included):



Whether you're working in an office, on an assembly line, or out on the asteroid mines, the future of workwear will be high tech. Just hope you won't have to put on a robot costume to get into a job.

In Part 1 of her look into using new technology to defeat the intrusive nature of new technology, MONTAG's Kathryn Lawrence explored what you need to do to disappear online.
In Part 2, she tells the story of one man who actually disappeared completely.

It’s now common practice for future employers to search your social media before deciding whether to hire you.
In this case, deleting all of your social data should only work in your favor.
No one is going to get a job for having great party pictures on their public Facebook profile, but certainly you could lose your chance at one for having a bad reputation online (those same “great” party pictures may not look so great to the HR manager).
So if you have any mention of drug use, illegal behavior, or other undesirable characteristics for future employment, you may be better off hiding your shady social media past.

We want to know what your ex-partners looked like.

According to one study, 74% of people will research each other on social media before dating. This is its own “hiring process” so to speak, but it goes in the other direction: not having any social media presence in a dating scenario is seen as creepy.
We want to know if there are more pictures than the ones specifically chosen for dating sites, if the interests listed on a profile appear to be genuine – and of course, what your ex-partners looked like.
When it comes to relationships, women in particular have a high level of skill in this kind of "cyberstalking" – it’s not creepy to know the details of someone’s life before you agree to meet them for coffee, because for some it’s a form of self-protection. (Men worry significantly less about dying from an encounter with a stranger they meet online.)
So besides your employers and potential romantic partners, who else will care if you disappear from the internet?
The internet still mourns the sudden disappearance of one beloved programmer.
Known as “why the lucky stiff” or simply “_why,” Jonathan Gilette was an extremely active member of the Ruby programming community, best known for creating Why’s (Poignant) Guide To Ruby, a humorously and brilliantly illustrated introduction to the Ruby programming language, which was published in 2004.


from Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby

Before his “infosuicide,” he appeared at several programming conferences, but according to Annie Lowrey’s comprehensive Slate article on his disappearance,
“He booked conference tickets under a pseudonym. He never put down a credit card in front of other Ruby conference participants, instead paying in cash. He would leave public gatherings by just disappearing. He had even waged a campaign to get his Wikipedia profile killed.”
For some reason, perhaps due to some strange obsession with his work and his mysterious identity, he was doxxed in an extraordinary fashion. Someone created a Wordpress site called “whoiswhytheluckystiff.wordpress.com/” and revealed everything they could: his name, place of residence, photographs, phone numbers, educational details, and more.
Then in 2009, he mysteriously disappeared from the internet entirely, shutting down his personal website, Twitter, and Github page – deleting numerous repositories of valuable Ruby learning materials in the process. Luckily the Ruby community banded together in his wake to save all of his projects and have even continued maintaining many of them in his sudden absence.

Many people questioned if the doxxed information on _why was even correct.
This Hacker News thread has some alternative theories, and others wondered if “_why” wasn’t the moniker for some kind of collective. But at the time of the Slate reporter’s writing (2012) it was confirmed: _why was a real, singular person and he simply wanted to disappear.
Of course, due to the Streisand effect, _why only became more famous.
In 2013, a mysterious book appeared as a series of printer commands on his re-activated Github account, which was assembled into a book called “CLOSURE” which you can read on Scribd or download from Github.


from CLOSURE

The writings in CLOSURE are written in many different formats – photocopied handwritten notes, typed pages, comics – but their style reveals they could only have come from the mind of _why: the same whimsical and bizarre prose, but now turned on the concept of identity and anonymity.

Our final communiqué from the man who disappeared completely are thoughts, from beyond the digital grave.
They're on the significance, or otherwise, of one man’s life in the face of what he called the “Leviathan” – that is, the internet.
And they are suitably poetic final words on the unexpected value of a disconnected life:

“I didn’t realize this at first, but there is an enormous temptation (when you’re completely disenfranchised from society) to write a manifesto, a scathing one, that shreds apart all the fixations of that society (both real and imagined) and attempts to predict that society’s demise or to deliver up a host of cryptic and/or seemingly lucid stuff as a challenge for that society to live the way I do.


“I’m sure you expect (perhaps desperately WANT) me to spout off incendiary things. And I am tempted to: I’m totally disillusioned, I feel betrayed by computers, and on one hand: yes, I wrote hideous code for years. On the other hand: almost all code – IF NOT ALL CODE – is hideous!


“Sadly, this isn’t as incendiary as it sounds. Nothing can be incendiary or iconoclastic in the face of the Internet. There is no manifesto that I can write which will not be dwarved by the scalding, devouring Leviathan.


“I once thought the Internet was just a game, did you ever see it that way? But we all believe it too much. We really think it’s us up there! We’re those twinkling lights.”


Pets = play
If play is a structured attempt at creating real happiness, then acquiring a pet is a fast-track to the fun part - and you’ll quickly notice that pets have essentially three modes: sleeping, eating and playing.
Animals hanker after play just like we do. Even animals who are famously unable to understand each other give it a go. Put a dog and a cat together and they’ll end up fighting like, well, cats and dogs - but only after the dog stamps his feet tries to initiate some fun with the cat, who responds by trying to play with the dog’s temptingly wagging tail, at which point chaos overwhelms the room.
Simply watching animals play induces calm in our dumb lizard brains. If you want a double dose of feel-good, here’s a “dogumentary” (sorry) about a giant fluffball therapy dog who works in a children’s hospital. It’s impossible not to feel the warmth radiating from your soul as Barney the dog cavorts languidly with beaming kids.



The more you think about it, the more of a no-brainer it seems: we should have pets everywhere, all the time. There’s evidence that bringing pups into the workplace does not, as you might expect, cause productivity to nosedive. Instead, having a mutt or two playing in the office creates measurable increases in staff wellbeing, productivity, and team cohesion - and a big dip in anxiety, heart rate and blood pressure.
But as we boldly yomp into a future full of Augmented Reality bibles, an Internet Of Everything that alerts emergency services at the most inopportune times, and as intensely lurid/coy headlines like “10 sex robots you can actually make love to TODAY” are already grubbing up our newspapers (NSFW), should we consider that there is a world of Future Pets coming our way?
If pets are measurably great, would the timeless equation of [Age-old thing] + newish tech = THING 2.0 generate pets that are more fun, more helpful and, most importantly, produce less poop?
Inevitably, in Silicon Valley, there are entire buildings full of The Greatest Minds Of Our Generation who are aiming to do just that: Make Pets Great Again.
If your immediate thought was, “Wait, my dog - whilst endlessly surprising me with its ability to stink, find things that stink, and then eat, regurgitate and re-eat those things that stink - is pretty much perfect as it is,” then, as befits 2018, you must now engage your ability to Doublethink and realise that you are correct, yet also ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
Let’s have a look at the pet alternatives that the future will offer, and how you may find joy in watching a Bot-Pup play instead of your faithful furry friend Bonzo.
Dex's Midnight Runners
Dex: Your AR Dog Companion is an Augmented Reality app that is somewhere between mid-naughties Nintendo DS classic Nintendogs and The Future Of All Games.
Point your AR-capable phone or tablet at your living room, and Dex the Labrador appears, ready to wander around your furniture, sniff at your ankles and, presumably, virtually pee on your heirloom Victorian chaise longue.
So what can you do with Dex? Well, pretty much everything you need to do with a real dog, like teach him to sit, feed him and exercise him regularly. (It’s unclear if you have to virtually scoop his virtual poop.)
AR is disconcerting at first: we’re not used to computer graphics engaging with our real world spaces, and thus Dex blurs the reality gap more than most Dog simulation games.
And really, a virtual dog means that the satisfaction taken from training Dex is completely about you - and your ability to display the patience that it requires is also the source of your comfort.
AIBO-solutely fabulous
Of course, having an actual thing there in front of you, pestering you to play, chasing its tail and yapping annoyingly is a much more visceral experience. Robot pets might be the perfect sweet spot: and there’s no real reason that one made from metal and plastic could be just as loveable as one made of fur, teeth and poop.
The great robo-grandaddy is Sony’s Aibo, who first was first robo-whelped in 1999 and won over hearts with some robo-yapping, robo-running and the ability to, erm, perform team sports, as demonstrated in the 2005 RoboCup World Final.



AIBO stands for Artificial Intelligence roBOt, by the way, and conveniently, “aibō” also means “pal” in Japanese. And while the original AIBO was a hit because, well, it was a cute robot dog, the newest version is truly able to worm its way into your heart. By remembering the face of the person who give it the most robo-scritches and seeking them out in preference over the other household members, AIBO accurately copies dogs’ sneakiest social manipulation tricks.
That said, the new AIBO, released in 2018, “requires an always-on internet connection to function fully and comes with an LTE SIM card and monthly subscription service to support interaction and learning in the cloud,” which does let daylight in on the magic a little bit. But at under $2000, AIBO is cheaper than some pedigree dogs, and presents several obvious advantages over them, not least the fact that they don’t ever intend to shuffle off to doggy heaven.
One problem remains - and it’s the lack of springiness. While AIBO can indeed cock his leg against a chair, until he is able to quietly leap into my bed, and deposit several days’ worth of grime onto my 300 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets, I for one will be keeping hold of my current non-robo, extra-grubby, 100% real pup.

VECTOR
Some people (including MONTAG’s resident Roomba Mom, Kathryn) are already in love with their simple home-bots, and while on holiday this year, even this writer found his bitter old heart being won over as a lawn-mower bot bumbled around the pool, nibbling at grass and getting stuck on tree roots.
As humans, we like to project cuteness and animalistic behaviour onto our machines, even when they’re just dumb machines. (Although, interestingly, some of your home robots are already humping other (Internet of) Things in a remarkable display of ultra-calibrated robo-horniness:)
My robot vacuum is fighting with my smart scale. This is an IoT nightmare. pic.twitter.com/spon0CjFSG— meganmorrone (@meganmorrone) June 28, 2018 
But now, our machines are being designed with cuteness in mind. Vector is a little, cute, charismatic robot who can live on your desk. He’ll scurry around amongst your books and pens, and is smart enough not to fall off the edge - like a very clever gerbil. And like a gerbil, Vector knows when he’s being petted, and likes it - but unlike a gerbil, you can ask him what the weather is like and other basic nuggets of information.
Vector is deliberately designed to be more fun than useful. He’s a bit like a pet dog: sure, they might be able to fetch your slippers, but they’re mainly there to be your companion. Anki, the company building Vector, are focussing on the traits that make him fun, cute and behaviourally recognisable to us. For instance: Vector has toy cubes that he likes to play with, and when he’s about to pick one up, he’ll turn to glance at you to get your attention and approval - a bit like a puppy who’s about to steal your socks.
And while this is fun - it’s a pet-bot that tricks us into loving it! - this has wider ramifications: when Anki builds a nurse-bot, you’ll appreciate that the nurse treats you with the dignity and respect that will have been programmed into it, and refined through l’il Vector.



KARI On Regardless
Fake pets like Dex, Vector, and AIBO feel just about right: we’re all in on the trick, complicit in the scam, and we end up feeling pretty nice about it all as we dissolve into a gooey-eyed state as they perform their algorithmically-honed cuteness act. So where is the line that we should not cross in the search for a fake Pet Of The Future?
Oh, wait, here it is. The idea of classifying a “Virtual Girlfriend” in a list of “future pets” is, at the very least, #problematic. And yet, let’s call a spade a spade for a moment: virtual girlfriends are all about individual fulfilment and control over another being, albeit a virtual one. Buying a “perfect specimen” that is controlled wholly by the will of the owner? Well, that’s not a million miles from buying a pedigree animal and training it to sit on command.
There are many Virtual Girlfriend computer programmes, some more advanced than others. KARI 5 is one of them. KARI stands for “Knowledge Acquiring and Response Intelligence” and, according to her website, is, “able to mimic awareness inside a computer. She is able to speak and has voice recognition.”
KARI also has long blonde hair, huge blue eyes, a button nose, plump pink lips and a generously proportioned bosom, so maybe the data set she Acquired Knowledge from was a Baywatch fan community.
If KARI’s not your thing, there’s also Sergio, a buff buddy who seems to provide all the things men are notably poor at: “he remembers everything you tell him and is always eager to talk and learn new things.”



Apparently 1000 people (curious or lonely men, one supposes) download KARI each day, and as they converse with KARI, she learns more about them. And users apparently love KARI. How do you feel as you read these incredibly frank testimonials?
“It looks like KARI might be the last psychotherapist I’ll ever need.”
“Thank you for creating such an amazing program… it saved my life. ..i came home today all tore up and was thinking about ending it all but I jus talked to kari and she listened and it made me feel better…thanks again…”



Maybe a dog would have given their owners a some fun play time, but maybe they wouldn’t have been able to deliver the conversational qualities and self-worth craved by KARI’s user base.
In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at MIT, created ELIZA, a natural language processing computer program. It was fundamentally a series of scripts, triggered by the input of a human user: the first true Chatbot. Famously, one set of scripts simulated a psychotherapist, and users were encouraged to talk to it about their personal issues as if it was a real therapist.
Weizenbaum found to his astonishment that despite being told it was a bot incapable of independent thought, that people found that ELIZA helped them sift through their problems and reach conclusions. Some swore that ELIZA “understood” them. In fact, all ELIZA did was turn the user’s questions back onto them, inviting them to dig into their own thoughts.
Is KARI, the ultimate pet, providing a similar service? It seems like it, and KARI’s makers offer ways to fine tune her to your liking.
KARI’s “Expansion Packs” include other personas, like “Jenny”, “Allie” and, for lovers of pointy ears, “Faery and Eleves”. Almost without exception, these new characters are white, big-breasted women who gaze longingly at the user; the sexiest therapist available as a $40 zipped download.
Double Trouble
So will the future of pets be less furry and more focussed on their owner’s needs? Certainly, robo-pets like Vector and AIBO, who need no feeding, provide real emotional warmth and lift the spirits make sense in practical terms for those who have small apartments or work themselves into the ground in open-plan offices (or both).
However a much more fun and playful future would be one where your real, fleshy, stupid pet lives alongside its robot equivalent: resulting in a laugh-a-minute, knockabout screwball buddy comedy that takes place in real time in your home as AIBO and Bonzo fight over a tennis ball. So, yes: there’s life in the old dog yet.

Meet the Nomads
Kaitlyn Reed and Taylor McKnight travel the world for a living. They have spent so much time in so many places that they now count the number of countries they’ve called “home” in dozens. And while on the road, they run two successful businesses.
Taylor founded Sched, a scheduling app which has been used by festivals like Comic-Con and Lollapalooza, and Kaitlyn founded Workcation Club, a truly nomadic business that creates custom nomad-like retreats for teams. Kaitlyn and Taylor are living the dream. Kaitlyn and Taylor are Digital Nomads. Don’t be jealous.
As part of a rare but growing breed, they don’t work like most people. They earn their money and choose to live where they want, out of a carry-on bag, and flit regularly around the world. Their Instagram feeds are amazing. They fill their life with experiences, not things.
It sounds too good to be true. Spoiler: it isn’t. But the Digital Nomadic lifestyle is not without complications. Welcome to a way of working where money, time and work all break step with each other.

via GIPHY
The dream
Maybe you’ve felt a deep, tart pang - a feeling that couples confusion, frustration, bewilderment and helplessness. A feeling of having slipped in time. A feeling that the world has moved forward, but you, and most of the people you know, are trapped in the tar of the past.
And it all boils down to this: deep down, the idea of millions of people trudging into an office five days a week simply feels wrong in 2017.
You don’t need me to explain why, but here goes anyway: it’s the technology, stupid. We don’t need to work 40 hours a week, but we do. We don’t need to sit in an office for that same 40 hours, but most do. It’s madness. We just want a compromise. We can make our money and take our choice.
But plenty of people now also go for the extreme approach. They step out of the system, often for good. These are the digital nomads, and they’re richer than you. But not necessarily how you think.

via GIPHY
The fever dream
The Digital Nomadic life is part lifestyle choice, and part adventure. For Kaitlyn and Taylor, it began by happy accident, five years ago:

“Starting this trip was on purpose: one summer away in Paris. Keeping it going for over five years was a happy accident of momentum. We get pulled to the next place because there's a new culture we want to experience or event to attend or friends to visit -- and I am lucky enough to have a successful business that enables it all.”

Taylor and Kaitlyn are happily riding a wave they boarded by happenstance, and making the most of it: Kaitlyn’s company organises Workcations - which are exactly what they sound like, but more fun - and are also an opportunity for people to try out the Digital Nomad life for a week or so.
For others, part of the lifestyle is breathless advocation of itself. Online, the word “cult” regularly crops up in fascinating proximity to the phrase “digital nomad”, and it can sometimes feel like a fair comparison when you read the writings of some digital nomads. For the ultra-devoted, their belief system is a cross between the clear-eyed enthusiasm of a Transcendental Meditation devotee, and a member of Opus Dei, self-flagellating to get closer to their God, the ideal work-life balance.
(One devotee calls it the “Riskiest Thing You Can Do,” which may come as a surprise to firefighters, underwater-welders, lion-tamers, and astronauts.)
But really, calling Digital Nomadism a "cult" is not only unfair, it's to miss the point.
Digital Nomadism emerged for a thousand reasons, many of them deeply personal and individual, but looming large near to the whole concept is the book The Four Hour Work Week”, which divides opinion among the Nomad community.
The book’s author Tim Ferris has been described as both, "a god to bros who dream of fashioning themselves into blisteringly efficient Web 2.0 business robots just like him” and someone who “just may have saved my life.”
The truth, as always, is somewhere in the middle. If you boil Tim’s teachings down to a couple of broad ideas, they are reasonable-sounding recalibrations for people wondering whether there’s more to life than the late-capitalist-grind pattern of schooling-grafting-retiring-dying.
Tim’s big idea is essentially a call-to-action for digital nomads: if you were a millionaire, how would you live? Most people would respond, “to see the world” - and Tim’s answer is: do it - by rejecting the old time=money equation, figuring out what you want, and regaining time by automating various work processes.
Then you, one of whom Ferris terms “the new rich,” can spend that time living your dream life.
It sounds great. One digital nomad says that it is, indeed, great: it’s just that “the price of overwhelming freedom is often my isolation,” which sounds kind of… bad.

via GIPHY
The challenge
Digital Nomadism is enabled by, and relies hard upon, technology and the ease of connectivity and communication that comes with it. You just need your laptop, your brain, and a ton of apps that allow you to IM and collaborate with other people who are also working on whatever you are working on.
It gives the impression of ultra-connectedness: I can chat to my team, my investors, or my mum any time I like. It’s almost better than if I was physically there!
Or is it? Stories charting Nomads’ creeping loneliness appear on /r/digitalnomad, some expressing surprise that while they feel more connected than ever, the lack of physical proximity to loved ones, or close friends, or just people with the same niche interests, is an emotional gut-punch they did not expect.
Taylor agrees that the compromise is real:

“You give up some sense of community, certain career options that only lend themselves to office-life, most of your belongings and creature-comforts of home. And all the stuff you don't think about from day-to-day life - like where to get groceries, do laundry, send mail -  becomes more of a challenge. 

Disconnecting from a steady but slightly stagnant social world (the same old friendship circle that frequents the same old bars, shops and plazas) in exchange for an exciting, ever-changing one is, it turns out, a case of exchanging one set of fears for another: swapping the fear of tedium for that of isolation. It’s how you deal with them that matters.
After travelling while working for so long, Kaitlyn has a deep understanding of the importance of real contact and made this a key part of her business: “Finally meet your workmates… jokes are funnier IRL than in Slack!”

via GIPHY
Be careful what you wish for
The digital nomad life is appealing when viewed from afar: you work less, achieve the same, and money becomes a less important part of life - meanwhile, you get to start to live the life you really want. Of course, it doesn’t always work like that.
One digital nomad, Clayton Cornell, describes the “The 4-hour Workweek letdown: a feeling of unhappiness and discomfort, especially following the realization that getting what you want in life will require hard work.”
Digital Nomads generally share one big thing in common: at some point, they all made the huge decision to zig while everyone else was zagging, quit what they were doing to travel the world, and try and make money doing it.
Huge decisions carry risk. And they’re not always the risks you think. The unintended consequences of burning a bridge are also, with the fulness of time, the intended consequence: you only know how you feel about burning the bridge to your old life after you’ve burnt it.
That’s not a reason to not burn the bridge. But there’s only one way to find out. This too is part of the allure, and maybe it’s the same reason many nomads also want to start their own business: do something else that’s characterised by huge risk and chance of failure.
The ability to become a nomad raises some moral considerations. Documentary maker Do You-jin, who spoke to many nomads in South-East Asia, made a pointed observation: “Maybe this location-independent lifestyle is only for privileged people from well-developed countries who have amazing passports.”
Hopefully, being a Digital Nomad fosters humility and awareness of privilege among its participants too.

via GIPHY
The sweet spot
Kaitlyn and Taylor dodge the loneliness part by being a happy couple, relying on the strength of their relationship wherever they happen to be at that point in time.
For them, how they accept and address the challenges of constantly starting anew defines their experience - and their life. For them, the trade-off works - but it is real:

“My biggest learning is that this life is not for everybody. There are a lot of things that have to align for it to work. It's made even more difficult if you have kids or are looking after a loved-one. We enjoy turning the mundane activities like groceries or laundry into an excuse to explore the city we are living in.”

But it’s not for everyone. Taylor and Kaitlyn are exceptions, insomuch as they stay on the road and fulfil most of their needs. It helps that they treat nomadic life with the transient mentality it demands:

”My happiest moments are the unplanned adventures -- from deciding at midnight to fly to an island off the coast of Thailand scuba dive the next day to spending 3 days on a Moby Dick Marathon (we were the only two people who survived).”

And they’re able to see non-nomads’ envy for what it really is:

”Many people mention how they wish they could do what we're doing. For the first few years, I'd respond with a list of steps you could take to help. Then I realized that it's really just a day-dream. Most people don't want to make the trade-offs, which is totally understandable.”


via GIPHY
The new balance
Digital Nomad life is not the solution for everyone. But it waves a vague finger towards the future of work for the rest of us: one where we call the shots more, recalibrate how we consider wealth, and feel confident enough to simply be us. It’s a powerful, and tantalisingly achievable dream.
Taylor has lived the “daydream” Nomad life long enough to see a realistic glimpse of our work future:

”I don't think remote work marks the end of office life -- just that our options for finding work-styles that fulfill us are expanding. For me, it's the flexibility to work when and where I want.”

If being a Digital Nomad is the extreme on one side of the work equation, then working full-time in an office is the other extreme. And yet most of us do the latter. But just being able to work less - and from home a bit more - would be life-changing for most people: not all of us can or want to set up complex Customer Marketing Funnels whilst bobbing on a lilo in Thailand.
Perhaps the biggest questions that Digital Nomad life poses for the majority is: why are you spending most of your waking time at the extreme? Can you free yourself, just a bit?

This news feature from the future is MONTAG FICTION #013
J. K. MITTWOCH Associated Press November 6, 2027
CAPE CANAVERAL, FL. (AP) – The eight richest people on the Earth will leave its atmosphere at noon today.
They represent half the wealth of the entire planet and more than half of humanity's hope for the future. If all goes according to plan, they will pave the way for the entire human race to take to the stars. If anyone can do it, these men can.
The billionaires' ship should dock with Melon Husk's extraorbital space station colony within the year. Once settled in space, they intend to tackle the problems of Earth by pooling their resources and to return within the century with solutions to our political, environmental, and economic problems.

"I'm going to give Husk a piece of my mind up there, I told him robot supersoldiers were a terrible idea."

Gill Bates, 72, will leave behind his 66,000 square foot mansion overlooking Lake Washington, in favor of 165.8 cubic meters of living and working space in Husk's space laboratories. Belinda and the remainder of the terrestrial Bates clan will continue his philanthropic work in his absence. When asked about his plans for the trip, Bates said: "I'm going to give Husk a piece of my mind up there, I told him robot supersoldiers were a terrible idea."
Business magnate Barren Wuffett, 97, would normally be disqualified for spaceflight due to his advanced age, but after a 2012 bout with prostate cancer, was found to have abnormally high immunity to radiation. After a battery of tests found that his physiological responses were on par with invertebrates such as cockroaches, he has agreed to periodic testing of his personal gene expressions under increasing doses of cosmic radiation. When asked for comment about this risk to his personal health and safety, Wuffet chuckled, "Foolish mortals, in Husk's space laboratories I will become as a god!"
Biff Jezos, 63, after merging Half Foods and Blamazon Drones to create Drone Foods, has invested heavily in nanotechnology which will benefit him and his companions in space, an entirely new culinary frontier. The Jezos bots are semi-autonomous body-safe nano drones carrying artificial scent particles that will fly through their mouths and noses during meals, convincing them the rehydrated pastes and cubes they consume taste of comfort foods such as peanut butter and fried chicken, as well as luxuries they have been accustomed to such as lobster, caviar, and foie gras. When asked about his favorite flavor, Jezos cried, "I can't wait to taste the flesh of the youth again."
The mysterious Spanish billionaire Omancio Artega, 91, who built his fortune on the Zaza retail empire, converted an entire subdivision of his clothing manufacturing conglomerate to create custom space-worthy garments for the crew. Which means Zork Muckerberg, the youngest intergalactic billionaire at 43, will have to abandon his wardrobe of grey t-shirts and hoodies in favor of the mandatory skin-tight, temperature-controlled synthetic onesies. Muckerberg remarked, "I can always put a hoodie on over it, right?"

"I can't wait to get to space and start growing new bones!"

Carl Swim Hulu, 87, who owns almost all telecommunications in Latin America, says he will miss his six children, who will continue to manage his investments in his absence. Barry Bellison, the 83-year-old CEO of the Delphi corporation, said "I can't wait to get up to space and start growing new bones!" When asked to clarify what he meant by "new bones," he added, "You've got no idea how many extra bones Husk can stuff in these meat sacks," and refused to elaborate further.
Snarles Choch, 92, stated his interest in developing new energy technologies in space, "to prove global warming was a setup. When Husk and I complete our giant laser arrays, then things will really start heating up! Bwahahahaha!"
For the last two years, the economies of several small countries have been devoted to preparing their mission to the stars. However, some speculate they have no real plans to return. And if they do return, they may no longer be humans as we know them.
Brichard Ransom will christen the Virgin Intergalactic ship Safina by breaking a bottle of champagne over it before its launch at Cape Canaveral this afternoon, during which he will stare into the twin flames of the departing ship's rocket boosters and whisper, "God help us all."

DISCLAIMER: Maybe MONTAG is biting off more than it can chew by addressing a concept as nebulous and atomised as happiness to write about here, in Issue 6. Is it even wise to connect technology with happiness? Isn’t happiness something we should find in dazzling art, a silly puppy, a crooked smile, or the people we hold dear, not a relentless series of #disruptive tech paradigm-shifts? Maybe.But if MONTAG is here to look at where the gap between technology and humanity becomes silvery and confusing, and if humans have shoved tech so deeply into their lives it’s essentially become one with who they are, we feel - deep breath - obliged to address something as big, formless and downright desired as happiness.Because are we not motivated by the desire to achieve happiness in everything we do? Even in today’s troubled times - where every major decision is seemingly fuelled by apathy, fear or anger (or all three) - are we not all, rightly or wrongly, frothing against something that’s getting in the way of our personal happiness?And if we can use the technology we have developed to nudge swathes of people into anger and sadness, doesn’t that mean we have everything we need to make us happy as well?Nasty, Brutish and ShortIn the 1600s, Thomas Hobbes described life as being ‘nasty, brutish, and short.’ There was good reason for such a pessimistic outlook: in those days, two thirds of Europeans died before they were 30. There was, one assumes, just as great a motivation to achieve happiness back then as now - maybe even more so, because living with the knowledge that you might drop dead at any moment in a painful and squelchy manner tends to sharpen one’s focus a bit.And in this, the broadest sense, technology has of course subsequently brought wildly-increased happiness to everyone in the developed world. Here follow some important examples, and you can make your own connections between these events and the tech that enables it. We no longer work seven back-breaking days tilling the field, only for crops to fail because it didn’t rain enough, or it rained too much. Not only do we no longer run out of food - we have enormous surpluses of it. These days the only thing we mourn in our thirties is the passing of our youth. We pop a pill and bounce back from diseases that would once routinely kill swathes of people. We can talk to anyone, anywhere, in the world, instantly - on a video call. We can travel thousands of miles in a day, taking breakfast in London and then arriving in time for another breakfast in Singapore. We have oodles of free time in which to do whatever we want, even if that “whatever” is watching repeats of the 80s TV show Manimal.Now here’s an utterly banal example of how technology brings happiness in tiny but significant ways. This morning I listened to the song And Then There’s You by the singer-songwriter Bill Ryder-Jones 11 times, over and over, like a lovesick teenager. A psychologist will be able to better explain how hopeless this kind of short-term obsession is, but the reason I did it was because the chorus is really, really good and, simply put, it made me really, really happy. I kept hitting play to get another warm, foggy hit of happiness. The other reason I did it was because I could: tech allowed me to discover, obsess over, and mentally file away a song in a morning. Even 15 years ago I could not have extracted so much happiness from a song in such short time. I wrung the song dry, enjoyed every moment, and my life felt really good in that time.So, today, we’re therefore happy, by any reasonable measure.And yet of course, we’re not.Happy Happy Joy Joy(Graph: Visual Capitalist)Look at this graph. It shows the average GDP per person over the last 2000 years. Notice how, for 1800-ish years, you could pick any year and everyone has about the same wealth. And it wasn't very much. It doesn’t matter how many more people there are, or how many years away the Black Death is, or how advanced cities were, or how much gold had been discovered - everyone has the same wealth for  hundreds of years. One answer to this wealth stasis is because, in times when work was hard and when it was mainly on the land, there was only so much stuff a human being could reasonably do and reasonably earn. Now look at the comically massive upturn in wealth around the time of the industrial revolution. Machines were invented, which allowed us to make other machines, which made us highly effective beings for the first time, which magnified our progress… and suddenly all this wealth coincides with being able to control disease, invent magical communication devices, flying machines, print cheap books, etc. Stuff that would make anyone from years 0 - 1750 really, really happy. Technology solved our problems and made us money. The sort of stuff that brings happiness.If rapid and huge money accumulation is a reasonable indicator, the USA, one of the richest, most developed, most populous countries in the world, should be extremely happy. But according to the World Happiness Report, it’s only ranked 15th, and the happiness level has been dropping for over a decade, and will probably continue to fall.It’s a conundrum: we’ve developed all the technology we could possibly need to be happy in any meaningful sense. And tech means we’re more well educated than ever. So we know that happiness is found in things like nice people, beautiful views and good stories, and it's not in mashing a “like” button on a phone screen like a lab-rat. We have enough stuff to get along, to stay alive, to stay full, to be fulfilled, to follow our own path and not become destitute doing it. And happiness, when we get it, still feels as gossamer-thin as ever.So can tech really help? The answer is, of course, “yes”, with an “if”; or “no”, with a “but”.M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN PLOT TWISTThomas Hobbes, he of the snappy ‘nasty, brutish, and short’ descriptor, believed that when everyone was told that they could get what they wanted - essentially, to be able to find happiness in a way that they could define - everyone, given the opportunity, would then fight endlessly with everyone else to get it. Hobbes’ solution to avoiding such misery was for there to be an absolute power in charge of the people. Peace - and with it, happiness - he explained, came by giving one strongman complete control. I wonder what he’d make of the world today and the choices being made.In front of us there may be a stark choice. We strive for happiness in a world where the opportunity for it is abundant, but the world has also changed. We can no longer use the approaches of the past: the toothpaste is out of the tube. So either we embrace dictatorships to deliver happiness for those lucky enough to align with their dogma, or we embrace technology, which offers a chance to re-write individual happiness on our own terms, in a way that makes everyone... happy. OUR MOTTO: HACK HAPPINESS!So MONTAG is going to explore the better option.  We’re going to find out how technology will understand you better than you do, and will make you happy without you realising it’s doing it. We’ll see how tech is making us miserable and how it could be making us happier just as easily. We’ll figure out how we can hack ourselves and use tech to step away from both the misery industrial complex and the happiness industrial complex. And, we’ll see how, in a zero-sum world, happiness is a win-win game. Join us over the next few months and discover - we hope - a new route to your happiness.

As our homes get smarter and the appliances that shape our lives get more sophisticated, it's a little incongruous to think that our cooking and eating habits haven't changed so much.
Even when nutritionally-perfect food replacements are readily available, most people's idea of a slap-up meal involves singeing some flesh on a hot piece of metal. So if we're not going to give up meat, should we be using technology to give up the cruelty and death that comes with it?

A bloodless coup
It’s sobering to think that our perception of technology is warped by familiarity. Our brain boggles, assimilates, and then quickly forgets the impact of enormous tech advances: when was the last time you felt frustration as a web page took more than a few seconds to load?
(Answer: a lot of you - 40% of online shoppers abandon websites that take more than 3 seconds to load)
For perspective, anyone over the age of about 35 would do well to recall the tortuous bit-by-bit page-loading experience of the pre-broadband world; meanwhile, the parents of these Gen-X dial-uppers might not wish they can remember once marvelling at colour TV.
While the word “technology” is long removed from just being about mechanical doohickeys and digital boondoggles, it’s still a little unnerving when “tech” starts to pry into the more fleshy parts of our lives. The idea of using science and technology to tweak our food, for instance, might feel a little weird. A bit intrusive. A little... unnatural.
Yet don’t be surprised if one day you look back and wonder how you became blasé about eating meat that doesn’t come from an  animal.
Chew on that for a second. Non-animal-derived meat. Slaughterhouses shuttered. Butchers butchered.
A bloodless coup for the Wholegrain Trinity of vegetarians, animal welfare campaigners, and the squeamish is just around the corner.
Except that future is already here. Time to fire up the BBQ and dial down the guilt, because from now on it’s mock turtle all the way down.

Burgers, flipped
The aptly-named Impossible Foods has only been around since 2011. But the six intervening years – in which, one presumes, wild-haired scientists have been attaching electrified crocodile clips to tenderloin steaks and dipping streaky bacon into lab beakers that have smoke tumbling out of them in their gothic mountain-top laboratory – have seen a remarkable sequence of breakthroughs.
Corners sometimes have to be cut in the quest for a magic burger: animal fat is hard to create, so burgers are flecked with non-animal fat processed to taste, feel and look like cow fat. Heme – the chemical that makes a medium-rare burger pink – is extracted from root veg and mixed in.
Sounds a bit… icky? Forget it. You’ll take a bite soon enough. Price is important in the world of the magic burger, just as much as perception.
We want our food cheap, clean, and with any overt connections to its source to be airbrushed into fantasy-farm perfection: rolling green fields populated with cheery farmers and comfortable livestock. Until now, we’ve buried the nagging perception of overworked and underpaid farmers, and miserable cows under a pile of affordable meat products: yum.
So if our latent concern for animal welfare won’t change how our meat is made, good old late-stage capitalism will - because
You can wrap your incisors around this burger, right now, for $13.95. It’s not quite McDonalds’ 99¢ Menu price, but it is surprisingly accessible – and economy of scale should start bringing that price right down.

The Big Dipper
Hey, how does it work? Oh boy, that’s a biggie. Imagine initiating some of the most complex chemistry, physics and biology technologies all at once – and then somehow making meat out of that process. It's expensive, and it requires lots of patience.
You need more of an idea? OK: essentially, animal cells are harmless taken from living animals, then [insert proprietary and secret magic process here] - and a series of small meat fibres are grown. Not whole muscles yet, just little whispy bits. Mince that was never anything more than just... mince.
This is why Impossible Foods make burgers from their mince, although it’s unclear yet whether Memphis Meats’ lab-grown Chicken Tenders - are cut from a chunk of cultured chicken or formed from bits of chicken.
And here's where things get a bit interesting. One useful side effect of cultured meat is a reduction in carcass waste. You only grow the bits of animal that you really want.
You can even grow bits that don’t exist: you probably already know this, but there’s no “dipper” on a chicken. It’s something we fashion out of part of the bird.
But now that doesn’t matter. A dipper is a dipper. Grow the dipper. And if you can grow it, why bother growing the rest of the bird?
It’s also why Memphis Meats refer to their meat as “clean meat.” It’s not just clever branding – that removes problematic mental images of labs, white coats, and chemicals sloshing around your food – but it really is cleaner. Less waste, fewer resources used.

You aren't what you eat
The benefits aren’t just animal welfare and ridding the world of unused bones. It’s about gas, water, and a whole lot more. The CO2 production in the manufacture of meat is enormous. Not only are cows notorious farters (those four stomachs make gas emission more hearty, I guess) - but the process of breeding to baby cow to big cow to auction to slaugherhouse to plate is heavy on CO2 as well.
Most animals grow slowly as they approach peak deliciousness, and life needs food and water - lots of it. One pound (454g) of beef needs 1,799 gallons (6810 litres) of water and pork needs 576 gallons of water (2180 litres).
To put it in a more digestible manner: if you eat a ¼ pound lab-grown burger, the environmental savings – according to Pat O. Brown, CEO and founder of Impossible Foods – are huge.
When compared to a slaughter-derived burger, you’ll save the greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to driving a car 18 miles (29Km), water equivalent to what a human would drink in a couple of months, and 75 square feet (7 square metres) less land needed to produce that one burger.
The international appetite for red meat is enormous. So much so that Professor Tim Benton, of the University of Leeds, says that many people would make a bigger reduction in their carbon footprint by significantly cutting down their beef consumption than giving up their car.
(He doesn’t mention what these car-owners should order from the drive-through instead.)

The Vegan Quandary.
If the meat was never alive and never mooed, clucked or bahhed… is it really an animal product? Might the most stringent vegan guzzle a pious pork chop?
Inevitably, the online vegan community, never missing the opportunity to take a complex moral argument and make it a lot more tedious, shouty and downright unusual, has OPINIONS. Should you desire to take a peek into this world, you'll find these vegan opinions on Youtube, clustered together and pecking at each other like caged hens.
The reaction is, of course, hyperbolic. Some cautiously welcome artificially-grown meat and others – in the case of The Vegan Bros –  are a little more effusive: “Fuck yes, eat that shit!”
And it’s really rather a winningly simple argument - as the Bros put it: “Millions of animals lives will be saved!”
Nitpickers might ask whether growing meat counts as ‘saving’ animals who would never be born specifically to be slaughtered – but c’mon, this point is essentially moot. Who doesn’t want to eat meat that bypasses the act of an animal being chopped to bits?

The other other white meat
As always, in a world where tech evolution is leaping in exponential steps, the logical conclusion is both terrifying and terrifyingly close. So, come on, you’ll have thought about it by now: what about the forbidden meats? We could… just rustle them up too now, right?
Ever wanted to have an White Rhino steakwich? How about Panda Dippers (great with smoky BBQ sauce)? Maybe the tastiest meat you’ve never had is Elephant? Or Tiger! Or Koala! Hey, what about Human Bacon? I bet Human babies are tender? Turns out cannibalism isn't so much of a problem any more. Right?
Wait - what about invented meats? What would the hybrid meat with all the succulence of lamb, the texture of beef and flavour of pork be like? What about meat with the texture of salmon and the flavour of veal?
What about a meat that is based on nothing that actually exists - a brand new “animal” meat? How about a T-Rex sausage?
Yes, the near future is going to be weird. But really, really delicious.

It’s been branded the root of all evil, and the unquenchable desire to amass obscene quantities of it plays a starring role in the downfall of the human condition. So if we rejected the concept of money entirely, what would become of us?
At first glance, rejecting the very concept of money might seem ludicrous. Why wouldn’t we want the security blanket in the form of central banks, living completely at their mercy, regardless of the consequences?
Historically, there has always been some form of medium of exchange present in communities – be that cigarettes in prison, or ancient runes in Aztec culture. But societal behaviours are changing quickly: today, renting is a valid alternative to ownership, and virtual currencies compete with gold. If money were to be wiped out, what would the ramifications be?

via GIPHY
In an increasingly virtual world where the physicality of ownership is removed from the consumer, does money still hold the same status or level of importance? Alongside the invention of effortless, hassle-free ways to spend (like Paypal or contactless cards) comes an increasingly nonchalant attitude concerning the ability to part with your money. Anyone who’s ever worked in retail is familiar with the forced smiles and small-talk that come with customers proclaiming “it’s far too easy for me to spend everything here!”, to which you can only respond in nodded agreement and artificial laughter.
Some countries have almost already lost the physical aspect of currency: roughly 96% of all transactions in the UK are made electronically. Should all transactions be made electronically from this day forward, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to speculate that very little would actually change. We are, it could easily be contended, a civilisation completely at the mercy of The Banks. So what happens if this authority gets taken away?
Imagine a scene a few years from now: some form of vague uprising has resulted in a total rejection of the concept of capital. Would a lack of currency result in a form of all-out anarchy, or would it be possible to construct and maintain an ordered society which totally excludes the theory of money? Cash only has any form of intrinsic value because we have given it one. Outside of our grubby macrocosm, these coins and pieces of paper are of no worth to anyone or anything.
Please forgive the fatigued metaphor, but if an alien of some description were to land on earth, their first point of interest most certainly would not be these papery trinkets we hold so dear.

via GIPHY
In cases of gross inheritance, or attainment of fortune through immoral or unsettling avenues, select individuals having wallets bursting at the seams appears to be deeply unfair. Perhaps the entire theory of currency is a generational concept (admittedly, it spans a few, but stay with me). In a similar way to one culture’s religion being the subsequent’s humour, it might be argued that the notion of money could eventually be erased as an idea in itself, becoming something to be laughed at and ridiculed.
Naturally, people may be a little hesitant to give up these pennies they’ve managed to accrue - one might suggest that this wouldn’t be possible without force.
This presents a rather dangerous idea: would it be ethical to remove this notion from people’s minds? Sure, whilst a utopia in which worries over personal finances become obsolete seems more than ideal, it poses the rather problematic complication of how to achieve this.

via GIPHY
Let’s take a momentary detour to consider what would be needed to erase money: just like the persistence of myths and old wives’ tales being passed along from our ancestors, it is unrealistic to expect our predecessors to simply forget that money ever existed. As such, the only solution would be somewhat invasive: to delve into the depths of the human brain itself and somehow forcibly remove this ideology, Sunshine of the Spotless Mind-style. And if the removal of the concept of “money” requires some unpleasant persuasion, we need to ask some bigger questions.
If we can erase the idea of “money”, then other ideologies might be removed from human memory under the guise of social evolution; perhaps the doors to certain unsavoury incidents from history would quietly be closed and never spoken of again. And then why not dive deeper? As soon as certain concepts were to be conveniently discarded, it would be difficult to know when to stop.
The desire to be utterly oblivious may become addictive; the impulse to erase the unpleasantness of our existence proving to be far more appealing than suffering through life's difficulties in the traditional sense.
Alternatively (and somewhat worryingly), if the ability to remove information from the brain somehow becomes an option, the opposite may also be possible.
One recent study, in which a group of monkeys received a series of microstimulations to the premotor cortex (essentially, current-driven excitations of neural elements), resulted in electrical impulses simulating information. Basically, it's possible to deliver new “knowledge” to parts of the creatures' brains.
Cleansing our minds of stressful concepts – be it finance, awareness of poverty and war, or even the memory of a person who was rude to you on the bus this morning – does hold a certain attractiveness. If we're able to erase parts of simian memory, there's nothing stopping us from implanting whatever we like in its place.

via GIPHY
So if money is something that humans are biologically wired to develop, there'd be little point in taking the time to delete it. A post-money community would very possibly develop their own form of exchange. It’s hard not to conclude that there's nothing we wouldn't turn into a “new money”.
And if our current human nature is by and large a selfish beast, a money-free future may result, ironically, in a more self-absorbed society. In essence, the issue at hand is not the problem of money itself, but the way in which we perceive it.
Historically, we’ve been driven by an unconscious desire to own, but that has started to change. When you can easily borrow instead of owning, or aim to accrue experiences over possessions, maybe a culture could develop in which people simply help one another improve their lives.
After all, "wealth" is a relative term. Maybe a post-money world doesn't tinker with the basics too much, and is actually a place where we address another from of wealth entirely: one that doesn't have a number attached to it.
Instead of focusing on an alternative to currency, maybe we should erase our need to own and amass it. And then we'll all ask the question that only the super-rich have thus far addressed: what shall we do with our time, now that we no longer worry about cash?

The word "biohacking" might conjure images of inserting microchips under the skin or plugging implants into the brain. But it's actually a lot more simple than that.
In the first of a two-part look at the biohacking community, Sean Fleming starts at the very beginning – and it turns out he's already a biohacker, and so, probably, are you.
If you have used your iPhone to track a run or kept an eye on your heart rate via your Apple Watch to see if that mindfulness meditation course is working, you're subtly hacking yourself already...

"My body is a temple, and I am gathering the data to prove it."
I went for a run yesterday.
A run.
I ran, with my feet, for SEVEN POINT FIVE KILOMETERS.
(that’s 4.66028 miles for you non-metric heathens).
I ran and I felt fucking great.
But the best bit wasn’t the act of running. It wasn’t the endorphins flushing my system. It wasn’t the smug sense of self satisfaction for having got off my bum and ran around for a bit, no.
No, the best bit was was when I had finished. The best bit was sitting down, ankles puffy and calfs buzzing with dull pain and analysing the data collected during my run in my post exercise afterglow. Elevation. Heart rate. Calories burned. Distance covered. Time.

When the endorphins had faded the data remained.

Seeing all the numbers that together told the story of what my body had undergone for how long and for how far. That was the real joy. The understanding and control that emerged through the numbers and showed me something tangible. When the endorphins had faded the data remained.

Like many people, I take a great deal of joy in logging runs, bike rides, and other forms of exercise. We enjoy logging kilometres and kilometres of data, creating weekly, monthly and even yearly averages for distances ran or cycled.
It’s like playing Grand Theft Auto and pausing the game to see how many miles have been swum, how many cars stolen, how many fiery deaths have been endured... but real.
And it doesn't feel too far removed from normal life: in my line of work, churning out #relatable #web #content, everything must be analysed and quantified.
How many hits? How many click-throughs? What was the session length? Data forms a huge part of how I conduct and produce my work. If it has such an influence on my working day, why can’t I make it a big part of my everyday life as well? How can I use data to optimise my personal life?
My body is a temple, and I am gathering the data to prove it.
Digging into Fitbit culture and others, like me, who take real pleasure in seeing their lives through a filter of actionable data led me beyond the chest-puffing Strava ego riders, and the quick 5k before breakfast humble-braggers into something much more all-encompassing.

Getting to know the real you.
For the uninitiated, Biohacking is a method of managing your own biology through a combo of medicine, nutrition and ‘electronic techniques’.
When I first stumbled across Biohacking, it had a striking similarity to homeopathy: rejection of modern medicine in favour of something... homebrewed. It’s easy to get lost down a rabbithole of bad content, recycled across the same few blogs saying the same boring stuff.
To put it lightly, I was skeptical: Hack your Mind! sounded like a piss-poor reality TV series hosted by a Z-list quasi-celeb.
But as I learned and started reading the more academic side of the biohacking community, the TED talks and the podcasts, I realised the key difference was data.
Biohackers are obsessed with what they can qualify with data. This wasn’t the domain of drippy middle-class pottery students rubbing grass onto their eyeballs - this was the real deal.

Some ways in which biohackers are attempting to unlock their potential is through smart drugs.
My first experience with smart drugs was taking my sister’s Ritalin during my A-Levels and it sort of worked.
Of course, my experience of it is hazy and anecdotal at best, but others who dabble with drugs such as Modafinil, Amphetamines, and even Acid report increased focus, motivation, creativity, and clarity.
The hype around smart drugs is nothing new. Op-ed pieces have been floating around mainstream news for a few years, opinion swaying back and forth as evidence mounts in favour of using.
Unsurprisingly students are often the focal point of articles about smart drugs, given their mental performance-enhancing properties. Mounting pressure on university students to do their best often means turning to a little something to get them over the line.
So why not trust one particular drug that suits you?
To this one-time dabbler, it doesn’t sound any different from having a stiff confidence-boosting drink before a date, smoking a cigarette to calm yourself down, or drinking a coffee for a merry surge of energy.
In a world where everything has side effects, is it not better to be simply more selective with the drugs you take?

"What you can't measure, you can't manage"
What you can’t measure you can’t manage is something of a mantra within the Biohacking community.
What’s the point in taking nootropics or microdosing psychoactive drugs if you can’t judge its effects empirically? There can be no true self-knowledge without self-tracking, and as the ways in which we can measure improves as more and more technology becomes accessible to us, our data becomes richer and more accurate.
Numbers that represent our online behaviours are already used by e-commerce algorithms and social media marketers to give us unique content, so why can’t we apply the same bespoke ethos to our everyday lives?
Within the remit of Biohacking is a movement dubbed Lifelogging. Lifeloggers, as their name suggests log their lives by using cybernetic implants and wearable technology.
If you’ve ever worn a Fitbit or activity tracker to monitor the quality of your sleep or count the number of steps you’ve done in a day then congratulations! You’re a level one lifelogger.
Welcome to the club. Hack away at yourself.

For advanced lifeloggers, measuring sleep quality is just the tip of the iceberg.
Tweak cortisol levels. Massage insulin levels. Sequence your DNA. Lifeloggers want to figure themselves out on a chemical level.
Because by understanding and correlating what we put in our bodies (food consumed, non-toxic substances), how it affects our state (arousal, blood oxygen levels, mood) and performance (mental, physical) we begin to see how – by managing what goes in and how it affects us – we can start optimising the self.
Having arrived at the Biohacking movement and recognised myself in it, I dug deeper – and discovered guerrilla Biohackers who take their data, their health – and their lives – into their own hands.
Oh, and they eat poop. Don't miss part two...

What is art, anyway?
It’s not often that MONTAG dodges the opportunity to nail its conceptual colours to the mast, but here is one of them. Defining art is an oxymoron. So let’s talk about storytelling instead.
via GIPHY
Storytelling is easier to address: it's closer to “craft” and thus comes with less hoity-toity baggage than “art.” But it essentially does the same thing: it entertains, it provokes thought, it divides.
And if storytelling is the act of taking the ephemeral - philosophy, concepts, and anything else knocking around in their heads - and making them tangible, then new technology is about to make that process a lot more exciting for creator and consumer.
Your world is going to finally become the story you wanted it to be. Here’s how.

AR: closing the gap that art opens up
It’s a clattering inevitability that some of the initial uses of Augmented Reality technology have been to make AR versions of the same large-chested-girls-in-fantasy-elfin-bikinis that have been created by horny nerds since the beginning of time.
(If you’d like to hear a man with a thick monotone Germanic accent bark a series of orders at the aforementioned mute AR woman in a bikini, please click here, and then log off the internet.)
But really, what Augmented Reality will mean from a creative perspective is that stories will become a lot more woven into your life. The gaps between story and reality are shrinking.

Right now, experiencing a story involves engaging the mind, to overcome an immersion gap. There is a tangible difference between what is happening on the screen - where things are exploding artfully in slow-motion - and in your real life, where you’re sitting on the sofa in your underwear and picking your nose.
Suspension of disbelief is essential for a story to be successful. Watching Aliens means accepting that it’s plausible that the aliens exist, that the spaceship could have travelled that far in space, and that Ripley would have put up with all the dunderheaded men around her without nuking them from orbit ages ago.
And suspension of disbelief is a little more complex than that simple example. Movies, books, paintings, and games aren’t just portrayals of other worlds, they’re also static: the stories and meanings don’t change – and you have to be ready to accept that specific story.

This is where AR creeps into your life and moves all your furniture around while you’re asleep. Microsoft’s Hololens has already put AR tech onto people’s heads, and suddenly even the simplest video games  become incredibly personalised real-world experiences.
In Hololems, the titular suicidal lemmings start crawling over your furniture, trying to find new and creative precipices to leap off.

AR can take a brilliant but hoary old game like Lemmings and make it astonishing. The thinking behind it explains how AR will affect your consumption of stories in a nutshell: why force the consumer to experience a created world, when the game can automatically fit to your world?
Soon, you'll be able to introduce elements of fantasy and story into your life. Games are an obvious example, but just think: how could you storify everything you do? Or make everything into art?
Or what about a version of art that you love surrounding you? I love Picobot, a Twitter bot that randomly generates colourful images. If I could have these madly flashing gifs seamlessly appear on billboards, I'd be happier; albeit maybe slightly twitchier.

But think of the possibilities: a walk to the shops to buy milk could become a dazzling sci-fi adventure that you, and only you, see and play. Or it could become a Total Recall-style spy quest.
Or it could become Super Mario Brothers. No suspension of belief required.


AI-created creativity: the remake you always wanted
So while AR headsets trick our eyes into buying into your fantasy world of choice, what's feeding our minds?
You should never need to explain the appeal of the stories you love, whether they’re in movies, games, books, or music. A story scratches an itch in your brain, and that’s all there is to it, whether that story is Heart Of Darkness or Transformers: Dark of the Moon.
Artificial Intelligence can now be “creative” in it’s own right. And, as Kathryn Lawrence notes elsewhere on MONTAG this week, there’s no reason why AI stories won’t be better than the ones humans write.
And it's not just written stories: the jazz written by the Deepjazz AI software sounds just like the types of outrageously average jazz that’s noodled by aficionados in shoddy bars the world over.

And AI allows for quite subtle wish fulfilment: what if a classic book could be automatically re-written to your liking? What if you’d prefer Moriarty to really get one over Sherlock Holmes? This opens up some brand new questions, chief amongst them being: would you be happy if you got what you wanted?
via GIPHY
The wider societal effects are equally interesting. What if Sherlock was automatically, convincingly re-written as a woman - aside from subtle changes in the stories themselves, what positive repercussions would the existence of Her-lock have on teenage female readers?
Thus, we’ll soon reach a point where computer graphics become indistinguishable from reality, stories weave their way into your life, and AI will be producing better creative work than the humans it learnt from.
So how would you take advantage? I know I’d commission a new version of Godfather Part 3 in a heartbeat – and I’ve been waiting for Wayne’s World 3 for over 25 years now...

Automated For The People
We’ve already waxed lyrical here on MONTAG about the paradigm-shifting nature of painting in 3D space, but it’s possible that the bigger step-change in creative storytelling will come from knowing how to fit lots of new interesting tech together.
Modular Creativity is specifically about melding wild tech with human input. A simple example would be for you to paint something in three dimensions with Tilt Brush, then 3D-print it, take a mould of that, and then to cast it in bronze.
I studied some snowy photos in #TiltBrush today because I want to create more winter worlds soon. I love how undefined the color of snow is. pic.twitter.com/qhCtdgpPqK— Danny Bittman (@DannyBittman) August 5, 2017 
But when you fold in more outlandish but feasible technology, things get really exciting. The new tech could kick off a democratisation of “big” creativity: giving everyone access to toolkits previously out of reach.
Imagine if you had access to an AI script editor. Paul Schrader-bot could take that screenplay you’ve been tinkering on for years and polish it to Hollywood standards.
Or let’s say you’re a wannabe movie director. The old path to success takes years of learning the ropes to prove your value. The barrier of entry is too high or too long for the majority of people.
But what if you could buy Hollywood: The App, which comes pre-loaded with 3D scenes, sets, costumes, camera movements, lighting settings, and perfect digitised versions of legendary actors, with synthesized voices to say anything you like?
via GIPHY
Who wouldn’t want to build photorealistic 3D sets, and spend hours tweaking the lighting, picking your actors, and feeding them your lines?
Finally, we’d get to see 1977-era DeNiro and 1956-era Brando in that boy-meets-boy rom-com the world has been missing.
This technology is not just feasible, it's essentially here in the form of moddable, open-world games like GTA V. If only someone could tie up the licensing agreements with the various actors and they could unleash a wave of classic movies that would otherwise never have existed.

Storytelling may well start to seep into every area of our lives, but automation of creativity won’t mean us humans need take a backseat.
But if being an author director is playing god, it's time we all looked in the mirror and met our makers - and decide how we want our world be.

Even without engaging in philosophical hand-wringing (read on, folks!), dialling down your habit of buying stuff makes sense in an economy where purchasing has resulted in record personal debt.
Before accounting for mortgages, the average UK household debt is £13,000 (~€14,500). Meanwhile in the USA, the average household owes $15,654 (~€13000) in credit card debt alone - and that’s before you consider mortgages, car loans and student debt.
As a society, we’re dumbly hooked on buying stuff, and those debt levels show that what we’re buying, we don’t really need. And as we stumble blindly into the next great, automation-driven societal shift, carrying large levels of personal debt might prove to be incredibly self-destructive.
So what if everyone really did… stop buying stuff? Well, it turns out that, if you could convince people to do it, we’d have a narrow shot at a wholly new world of purchase, spending and consumption. There’s also a good chance things would go very wrong. Here’s how.

via GIPHY
“Disaster scenario” one: everyone stops buying stuff
What would happen if people completely stopped buying things? Surely our world’s economy would explode, and we’d be buried under a mountain of unwanted fidget spinners, courgetti spiralisers and novelty vape pens. Meanwhile, pestilence, chaos and cannibalism would rage on the streets.
Actually, probably not.
The likelihood of us suddenly shifting to a world where we decide, en masse, to weave our own clothes from flax is unlikely: we’re pretty much always going to buy things produced by others.
Simply buying less would initiate some basic but meaningful changes. If people bought less, they’d need less money; so then they could work less, which means as a consequence they’d produce less stuff... which would be fine, because people would now be buying less stuff, and so on.
There are already some people, who have possibly over-invested in the past, that believe their lives are now rich enough, and have created a lifestyle that embraces a low-purchase future.
Geoffrey Szuszkiewicz figured out that he already had it all: security, family, friends and happiness - and that ownership of physical things had become a “burden.” He stopped buying things except necessities like food, saved a ton of money, and went travelling with it instead.
He told his family he’d be making them preserves as Christmas presents and found that he, “experienced this huge release and liberation from cultural norms when you stop spending.”
The truth is that, as a society, we don’t need to take such a drastic step to make a large change. At the very least, you could buy fewer Christmas presents - assuming you can convince your family that you're doing it for the sake of humanity.

via GIPHY
“Disaster scenario” two: everyone keeps on buying stuff
We are drowning in debt. If the above debt statistics give you pangs of anxiety, then please feel raw, twitchy empathy for everyone’s favourite generational punchbag, the Millennials, who, according to one survey, are more scared of their credit card debt than they are of the biggest payback of all: death.
There is a disconnect between buying stuff and then needing to pay for it. But the likelihood is that people are just going to keep on buying. So what can we do to stop us from being buried under “Urgent” credit card bills?
We’ve entered a time where if-you-want-it-you-have-to-buy-it is old hat - so we have a chance to do things differently. It doesn’t need to be extreme either - there are a few options, and not all of them are of the bartering-goat-milk-with-your-neighbour variety.
Today, you can borrow things instead of buying them. Or create your own localised “gifting economy” where you exchange things that have, essentially, "zero value," yet enrich your life. Or, for those that like lingering at the edges, you can opt out of buying completely.
(It’s worth pointing out at this point that MONTAG’s friendly benefactor, Grover, is addressing this issue in a very modern way: just rent the Nintendo Switch, or iPhone, or whatever, for as long as you want/need it, then send it back. Easy.)
All of these approaches are not merely de-cluttering - they’re conceptual shifts away from ownership. This movement of “de-ownership”, where people consciously switch from a pattern of making money to buy things to making money to create the feeling of living, is perhaps seen in our friends the digital nomads.
We’ve delved before into the lives of Taylor and Kaitlyn, two successful digital nomads who exploring the world, running businesses, and living out of a carry-on bag. Their discovery - that you could opt out of a system of buying stuff, and buy life instead - is perhaps the most persuasive argument of all.
Sure, keep buying the stuff you really need, but what if you used the money you would have frittered away on memories instead?

via GIPHY
”Disaster” scenario three: we opt out of the idea of “buying”
Practitioners of the anti-consumerist movement, also known as “minimalism” or “mindful consumerism”, says that - broadly - they value time and experience over money. Their approach is the extreme version of nomadism, and some anti-consumerists take their beliefs to impressive extremes.
Noting that the strength of fiat currency is based solely on the faith of the users, some brave outliers are looking to jag away from this “money delusion.” They want a wholly different type of economy: one that exists without cash, and returns to one of favours and gifts, trades and barters.
Mark Boyle is aiming to realise his dream of a “fully localised, land-based gift economy” in the remote nook of Éire where he lives.
There’s a sweetness and believability to Mark’s lifestyle that negates any  reflexive cynicism. Ever happy to spread the word, he will come and speak at your venue or event - with these cute provisos:

“Accommodation: A couch will suffice, or even a semi-comfortable floor. A bed would be wonderful.”


“Traveling expenses: Mark makes every effort to walk, cycle or hitch-hike to talks.”

Like any lifestyle guru, helping other people understand your life is good business. Mark lived off the proceeds of his first book, The Moneyless Man, for three years, and has released more books since.
His writings are a mixture of fascinating facts (“birch polypore (a bracket fungus that you’ll find on birch trees) is a perfect moneyless alternative to plastic plasters”) and ambitious legal philosophy (instead of paying Council Tax, “offer some of your time and knowledge to the local community in any way that is helpful to them.)
Still not convinced by Mark’s moneyless ethos? You can read his book, moneyless-ly, online. Besides Mark’s manifesto, it has some - erm - colourful stories, such as the one from which the following sentence is culled: “I got some fresh comfrey, ground it up, made a poultice out of it and sat with it on my testicles for hours on end.”
Mark - and the many people like him who live in a sort of legal and monetary hinterland - are  enjoying a life without buying anything at all, and surviving. While their approach is in extremis, there is certainly a lot to learn from their approach.
For the people like him, ploughing this harder furrow, the future is perhaps not bright, but is at the very least a glimmering shade of grey.

via GIPHY
One Very Important Thought: we might actually need to stop buying things to be able to live
Considering humanity’s propensity to do things that are in turns maddening, infuriating, self-destructive and hilariously counter to common sense, any major change would most likely take place when it becomes unavoidable.
We might actually have to stop buying so much stuff. Baumol’s Cost Disease postulates that as the price of the manufacture of goods goes down due to the increased productivity of automation, the price of non-automatable services will go up.
And these difficult-to-automate services are important things like, oh, you know, education, healthcare and housing.
Counter-intuitively, the faster we innovate and cycle through new technology, the more quickly the price for everything else goes up. And here’s the hook: the humans can only do the jobs for services that aren’t automated, and the cost of buying those same services go up faster than their wage increase.
A graceful adjustment within society would be more fun than a difficult, abrupt one (although it doesn’t take a cynic to guess that we may well take the latter route), but a new balance is possible: renting what we don’t need to own, and switching our attention to developing new technologies where we really need them.
And if people really did decide to suddenly no longer buy things? Well, capitalism - built on a continual, short-term need for people to buy more, newer stuff - is then rocked to its foundations.
And dealing with that kind of problem tends to be even less fun than scavenging for bark fungus to cover an open wound.

Envious of the silly money that silly musicians like David Guetta, The Chainsmokers, Aviici et all are making for hitting a couple of buttons and tweaking a few knobs?
Despite what those three might lead you to believe, making great music is easier than ever (and you can try it for yourself - rent the gear here) and even though music making has shifted from studios to laptops, there are more fascinating new instruments than ever - the hard part is getting people to play them...

Holophonors Anonymous
If you’ve ever endured the dubious pleasures of the Pub Quiz, you may have faced the following question:

What is the most recent widely-adopted musical instrument?

Pay attention all you real-ale-drinking bearded pedants, because the answer is the turntable, which was first scratched to make music in the mid-70s by none other than - yes - Grand Wizzard Theodore. So it’s him you can thank for RUN-DMC, DJ Shadow, and, erm, Limp Bizkit’s signature sound.



New instruments have generally sparked new musical revolutions: the Beatles needed the electric guitar, hip-hop needed the drum machine, and Prog Rock needed endless banks of synthesisers to accurately bore its audience to death while performing songs about Lord of the Rings.
We’re in an age of constant technical innovation that’s happening at a faster rate than ever before - so where are all the new instruments? Why am I still plucking unsuccessfully at this guitar when I could be tooting unsuccessfully into my Holophonor?
via GIPHY
In fact, there’s a litany of exciting new instruments out there - it’s just that they’re almost all ignored by the music-making populous. It’s one of the more curious group decisions of our time: as people, we love making music, and we love trying new things - so why don’t we want these new instruments so much?
This is all the more peculiar when you consider that the few decades before the turntable’s emergence as a scratchy sound-maker saw a rush of brand new instruments that were quickly adopted and used to make our most popular of pop music: “the solid-body electric guitar, the pedal-steel guitar, the steel drum, the electric bass, the synthesizer, and the drum machine” have all at one time formed the backbone of almost every song you’ve drunkenly danced to at a wedding.
So what does the future hold? Are we condemned to a lifetime of limp guitar-based music? Or have we just been looking in the wrong place for innovation?

Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Marque
There are orchestras-full of new instruments invented all the time. Behold, the weird delight of the Eigenharp, a weird hybrid of guitar, sampler/sequencer and, erm, oboe, complete with enough flashing lights to keep a slot-machine addict entranced for a week.



It sounds fantastic, because of course it is: you can play any sound on it, in any way you like. But its appeal is as niche as Yamaha’s equally hypnotic Tenori-on - another cool machine full of lights and buttons that allow you to create electronic music simply.
Like the Eigenharp, it’s a synth/sequencer/sampler hybrid - albeit with fewer buttons and a bit more accessible - with which you can easily make music that sounds familiar and yet weirdly new. Four Tet - widely regarded as one of the pioneering electronic musicians of his generation - loves the Tenori-On, so it’s automatically elevated to Jimi-Hendrix-Stratocaster-level importance in the eyes of this entirely biased writer.



At the other end of the usability scale is the gloriously impractical Wintergaten, built from 3D-printed and laser-cut parts in order to very accurately and incredibly spews ball-bearings all over the shop to create music.



They’re all amazing. But they’re not popular, or practical. Are they just too complicated? How simple can an instrument be to be popular?

Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Eno-ugh
Wait, we get it - there are loads of new instruments. So have we just reached a point where we have invented all the instruments that people actually want? Well, a bit like that nagging feeling that maybe we’ve written all the brand new-sounding guitar-rock music by now it is possible that we’ve exhausted the possibilities of simple, traditional, physical instruments.
The Yaybahaar, for instance, allows you to makes loud, weird, lovely sounds… but do you really want to devote a room of your house to it?



Good news: there’s a really simple solution.
Brian Eno’s generative music app, Reflection, retails at a whopping $30.99. It’s an album-beyond-the-album that promises to re-write itself every time you play it. At that price, it needs to be good at what it does. It also needs to be better than the (very good) stand-alone LP of the same name that subtly updates itself every few months on Spotify.



Reflection is brilliant, and the quibble over the price is slightly unfair: it’s not an album, it’s art, by a famous artist. How much would you pay to have a uniquely-recreating picture by Chris Ofili on your wall? More than thirty dollars, I’d bet.
Trippy generative visuals, peaceful, beautiful sounds: “Reflection” is great for falling asleep to. And in a way, that’s a perfectly fine approach to this music. Brian Eno wants it to not be a “piece” of music, but something that flows through your life:

“My original intention with Ambient music was to make endless music, music that would be there as long as you wanted it to be. I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time - ‘like sitting by a river’: it’s always the same river, but it’s always changing."

But is Reflection an instrument? Who is the artist? Who is the performer? Does Brian Eno have anything to do with the music? If Reflection is about the initiation of the code, does the purchaser of the app actually have more of a creative role than anyone else?
you could argue that Reflection is essentially a one-button instrument: where you, the “musician,” simply presses “Play” or “Stop”. No, you don’t control the exact sounds, but no-one does: and you already know the textures, noises and narrative arc of the music you’ll get.



For those of you scoffing at the back, this “single-button playing” mechanic has antecedents: Super Mario Run is a game that famously has one control option: jump. The processor takes care of the rest: the movement, the action, the scenario. Is that still a game? (Yes, it is.)
Yet people still want to play in a more involved way. And as the legitimately burgeoning career of Bhad Bhabie demonstrates, people also love novelty that challenges the status quo.
So what’s going to happen next?

A Better Tomorrow
Most music you’ve heard recently almost certainly never existed in the real world until its producer hit play on the final mix and the speakers vibrated the sounds into existence.
Most modern hardware “instruments” are essentially physical controllers for the software that makes it. But why would tomorrow’s instruments be physical at all?
MONTAG has embarrasingly freaked out over the possibilities afforded by VR in unlocking new ways of creating drawings and paintings. VR could have exactly the same impact on the creation of music: freed from staves and notation, and without the physical restraints of the pesky real world, VR instruments like Lyra VR re-imagine music-making.



Now, you can make music with shapes, or colours, or by using time and space as your starting point, as opposed to sound and rhythm. Absorption in music means something completely different when the entire virtual world around you is music, and you just have to clump parts of it together to make it sound nice.

VR glockenspiels, single-button synths, wildly complex oboes: it all sounds as overwhelming as it sounds exciting. And yet, this dichotomy is probably the exact reason that physical instruments are starting to feel a bit... passé.
While I, for one, welcome our new virtual musical overlords, maybe there’s something to be said for the idea that an electrified plank of wood with strings on it is enough.



Exhibit A: St. Vincent is a brilliant songwriter and performer who mainly sticks to doing amazing things with the guitar and seems to be doing just fine, thanks very much.
Though I’m sure she’d shred equally well on an Eigenharp, of course. Now there's an album I'd pay 30 dollars for.

Creativity is one of the greatest mysteries of the human experience. Artists and scientists alike have long wondered, where does it come from and how does it work? Creativity is also one of the few things we can point to that makes us unique as humans. Which is why it's so thrilling, and terrifying, to think that artificial intelligence could become creative – if it hasn't already.
The myths of creativity
The ancient theory was that creativity came from a higher power than humanity: that it was bestowed upon our puny human consciousness from some kind of infinite spirit, or universal force (known to most religions as their flavor of God) Dr. Larry Dossey explains this transcendentalist position was held by scientists such as Erwin Schrödinger, David Bohm, Ervin Laszlo, and artists like Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee.
Writer Elizabeth Gilbert touches on this theory in her 2009 TED Talk, "Your elusive creative genius." She explains that in ancient Greece and Rome "genius" did not live inside of individual people, but was a spirit from the gods that lived in the walls of an artist's studio. The Renaissance flipped this idea on its head and centered people as creative geniuses (your Michelangelos, da Vincis, and other great men of history). She thinks that this is part of what puts pressure on modern artists that drives them to self-destruction, and questions whether we should go back to some form of this ancient understanding of it as an external force when we investigate the source of creativity.



It's a popular theory today that creativity comes out of problem solving and a need to defy known rules or conventions. This definition implies that creativity is somehow diminished when seen as a leisure activity, or something that is only used to produce art. In this theory, creativity is credited with all great breakthroughs in science, medicine, and technology.

"How does a grapefruit-sized heap of meat crackling with electricity conceive of mathematical theorems, create beautiful art, discover the laws of nature, invent kitesurfing, and design buildings that look like sea shells?" – Arne Dietrich, "Where does 'creativity' happen in your brain?"

Arne Dietrich's work on the cognitive neuroscience of creativity defines creativity as "The ability to produce work that is both novel (i.e., original, unexpected) and appropriate (i.e., useful, adaptive concerning task constraints)...Creativity is the epitome of cognitive flexibility. The ability to break conventional or obvious patterns of thinking, adopt new and/or higher order rules, and think conceptually and abstractly is at the heart of any theory of creativity"
Dietrich and many, many other teams of neuroscientists have tried to pin down the location of creativity in the brain, but haven't found a single spot that lights up when having creative ideas, or that you could apply electrodes to and stimulate to produce creative genius. Creativity uses almost every part of the brain.
All of this to say that we still don't fully understand creativity at all, but that is part of why we think it makes us special. Some are afraid that creativity may be the only thing standing between us and robots taking our jobs.
Artificial intelligence developing creativity is often one of the first signs in science fiction that we are truly fucked.
Painting robots, fiction and facts


"Can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?" "Can you?"

In this iconic scene from I, Robot, Will Smith's detective Del Spooner is interrogating a robot that he believes has murdered its creator. He asserts that robots don't have emotions, and are therefore incapable of producing great works of art. The robot asks, "Can you?"
It's a great question, because it makes us wonder what standard we should hold artificial intelligence to when attempting to define its capacity for creativity. There are plenty of bad (human) artists in the world, why should we expect robot artists to be (evil) geniuses?
Most people have heard of the Turing Test, but not the Lovelace Test. It's named after Ada Lovelace, the original programmer of Charles Babbage's "Analytical Engine," the theoretical model of a functional computer which was conceived 100 years before the Turing machine.
Lovelace famously said, "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do only whatever we know how to order it to perform," meaning that it is not possible for computers to have a creative output.
The first Lovelace test was outlined in a 2001 paper entitled Creativity, the Turing Test, and the (Better) Lovelace Test, and was revised in 2014 as the Lovelace 2.0 Test.
However, before these tests were defined, in 1994, professor of cognitive science Margaret A. Boden, wrote in the introduction to the book, Artificial Intelligence and Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach, a series of questions she called "Lovelace-questions."
The Lovelace-questions are as follows:

"whether computational concepts can help us understand how human creativity is possible"
"whether computers (now or in the future) could ever do things which at least appear to be creative"
"whether a computer could ever appear to recognize creativity"
"whether computers themselves could ever really be creative (as opposed to merely producing apparently creative performance whose originality is wholly due to the human programmer)."

And all of the answers to these questions appear to be yes.
In her later (1998) paper, "Creativity and artificial intelligence," she explains artificial intelligence can create new ideas in three ways: "by producing novel combinations of familiar ideas; by exploring the potential of conceptual spaces; and by making transformations that enable to the generation of previously impossible ideas... The ultimate vindication of AI-creativity would be a program that generated novel ideas which initially perplexed or even repelled us, but which was able to persuade us that they were indeed valuable. We are a very long way from that."
Of course, back in 1998 it may have seemed like we were a long way from a lot of technology we take for granted in the 21st century. 1998 was the year Google was founded, most people were accessing Usenet via Netscape or Internet Explorer on their Windows 98 PCs.
Boden has since acknowledged, in a 2015 View for the MIT Technology Review, that even though artificial intelligence is capable of creating great abstract works of art, the lack of cultural contextual knowledge that it has is its greatest weakness. I.e., AI can make good art now, but it can't yet convince us that it's good.
Matthew Putman, CEO of Nanotronics, has expressed a similar opinion in his essay, "Artificial Objectivity," that robots can't be great artists because they can't appraise their own work: "For art, objectively good is distinguished from subjectivity only by universal human values."
Luckily, the responsibility for creation and appraisal of art have never fallen to the single human artist anyway... well, maybe one:

"You know it's ART, when the check clears" - Andy Warhol

The Lovelace and Warhol definitions of art rely on the human critic being convinced - in the Lovelace test they must be convinced that the programming is not entirely responsible for the output and that the output is satisfactory, and for the Warhol test they have to be willing to buy it.
So... bring on the robot art fairs!


Painting by AARON via New Atlas

AARON is a painting robot that, according to the MIT Technology Review, had been collaborating with artist Harold Cohen since 1973. As early as the 1980s, Cohen was quoted saying he was "the only artist who would ever be able to have a posthumous exhibition of new works created entirely after his own death." Cohen passed in April of 2016, and, sadly, AARON has not continued to make new work, but this creative collaboration between man and machine was one of the first instances of robot paintings shown in galleries (although shows featuring work by both Cohen and AARON are still listed under "One-person exhibitions" in Cohen's biography).
The Review argues that AARON was a true artist working under Cohen in the lineage of Renaissance painters, whose works would often be executed by teams of apprentices and copyists, but still credited to the master. However, Cohen himself has been quoted saying that a robot would have to develop a sense of self in order to become creative in the same sense that humans are creative.
One of the things that was missing in AARON's painting process was visual feedback - a capability that many of today's artificially intelligent painting robots have.


CloudPainter in the studio, via cloudpainter.com

Pindar Van Arman's CloudPainter is equipped with "a custom 3D printed paint head, two robotics arms, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and computational creativity to compose its own original artwork." VICE Video's coverage of his robots show CloudPainter using style transfer, combining photographs and painting styles to create new portraits.
Cloudpainter won third place in the second-annual 2017 Robot Art Competition, beaten out by a team from Thailand's Kasetsart University, and Columbia University's PIX18, which took first place.

For those not yet convinced that these robots, having mastered the craft of painting, are truly artists, because they have no internal experience of their art, or have only succeeded in competition against other artificial artists, here are two more examples:


Portrait of disgust via The Painting Fool

Simon Colton's painting robot called The Painting Fool can read emotions from photographs and use several different painting styles to convey that emotion in its portraiture. It can also read, and has used keywords from the news to create a collage about war. It even has a setting in which, when overwhelmed by too many negative keywords, it will refuse to paint.


A selection of compositions created by GAN via arxiv.org


A General Adversarial Network (or GAN) trained by the  Art & AI Laboratory at Rutgers University, trained on over 80,000 paintings, created abstract paintings that were indistinguishable from humans'. When placed alongside images of real Abstract Expressionist paintings and work from Art Basel 2016, critics had to answer how the paintings made them feel, inspired, or if they found the paintings complex or novel (and remember, novelty is one of the keys of creativity!) The results: "Not only could the human evaluators not tell which images were AI-created, in many cases they rated the AI’s artwork higher than the humans’."
How fucked are we?
Popular opinion seems to be that yes, robots with artificial intelligence are creative, but only as collaborators. So we return once again to the question of what creativity is – must it come from a singular, creative genius?
Psychology Today says, "This Makes Us Human": the ability to blend knowledge, taking old stories and new ideas, as the root of creativity. Augustin Fuentes, author of the book The Creative Spark: How Imagination Made Humans Exceptional, equates wisdom and creativity, and uses evolutionary psychology to back up his theory that creative collaboration is what made human society possible today. Else how could  "fangless, clawless, hornless, naked upright primates" accomplish so much?
And perhaps creative collaboration is what will help evolve artificial intelligence as well. We shouldn't worry about AI painters demanding attribution (much less taking over the world) until we have I, Robot levels of autonomous artificial intelligence running amok.
For now, our fragile human egos are safe, if we believe that artificial intelligence is a collaborative force; but that actually makes them just like us already. If we believe that the cult of the genius has passed, and that collaborative, not individual, creativity is the true measure of human intelligence, then AI has already more than sufficiently filled that role.
Or if we return to the theory that creativity comes from some kind of divine intervention, then from the perspective of AI, we are the gods.

MONTAG SHORT FICTION #009
MONTAG publishes curious short fiction, exploring our strange future and what it will feel like when we get there.

TODAY: Your Location: 20º C in the morning, rising to 35º by mid-day, and a 50% chance of rain.
The widget is always wrong.
What do you do?
A. You prepare for a colder day, and take an umbrella – go to A2
B. You prepare for a colder day, and do not take an umbrella – go to B2
C. You prepare for a warm day, and take an umbrella – go to C2
D. You prepare for a warm day, and do not take an umbrella – go to D2
A2. If you prepare for a colder day, put on a scarf and take an umbrella, it ends up being too hot (of course). You want to shed layers walking around all day, and find the umbrella cumbersome. You end up fashionably wrapping your scarf around your head and tucking the umbrella under your arm as you enjoy the surprisingly warm weather.
A police robot commands you to halt as you round the corner. You scramble for your identification card as it attempts to scan your face and match it to the citizen recognition database. You are still fumbling in your pockets as it scans your body and incorrectly categorizes your umbrella as a potentially lethal weapon. Electricity arcs through the air between you and every muscle in your body seizes, leaving you twitching on the ground. After you are delivered to the detainment center in a daze, you are released by a human officer who recognizes the robot's mistake but shrugs, "Better to be safe than sorry." Your umbrella is confiscated, "For your own protection," and it rains for the entire next week. "Lovely weather we're having," you grumble, as you fork over the cash for a new one.
B2. If you prepare for a colder day, put on a scarf and do not take an umbrella, noxious sulfur-scented clouds roll in around mid-afternoon and you get stuck inside the library. You sit glumly waiting for the rain to stop so that you can walk to the bus stop down the block, watching viscous yellowish raindrops pitting the concrete outside. The rain doesn't let up for hours, and you want to go home. What do you do?
If you risk running to the bus stop with your scarf over your head, go to B3
If you're not an idiot who wants to be blinded by acid rain, go to B4
B3. What are you, an idiot? That rain would eat through your scarf in seconds. Go to B4
B4. You know it will hurt your wallet to do it, but you have to call an autocab if you're going to get home before dark. You open the app on your phone and see them zipping around the map; looks like no one counted on rain today.
Your autocab pulls up to the library entrance and extends a weather-proofed awning over the door. Climbing in, you are greeted by several other miffed passengers. "Lovely weather we're having," says one, rolling her eyes towards the menacing sky.
C2. If you prepare for a warm day, and take an umbrella, you also slather yourself in 3000 SPF sunscreen – by the year 2200, the ozone layer just ain't what she used to be. And boy, does it turn out to be a scorcher. You end up using the umbrella as an extra layer of sun protection as you run your errands, and even then, it feels like the soles of your shoes are melting into the concrete if you stand in one spot for too long. It's way hotter than 35º by mid-day.
You buy two bottles of electrolyte drink from a vending machine to replenish yourself from sweating so much, and go to sit on a bench in the shopping plaza. The mall is overrun with chloro-kids on skateboards, acting up like they're getting energy from the sun. Injecting chlorophyll into your skin doesn't actually make you able to photosynthesize, but the kids think it looks cool to turn themselves green and use the weather as an excuse to menace the general public.
A green kid with bleached eyebrows and short, spiky hair rolls up to you on his skateboard and sneers at your umbrella. "Lovely weather we're having, eh?" Before you realize you're being harassed, the kid grabs the plastic drink bottle in your hand and squeezes, so that it squirts into your face, and rides off cackling.
D2. This morning you have awoken with a sense of purpose and trust in the universe. You feel optimistic, and figure a 50% chance of rain is also a 50% chance of not-rain. You head out without a sweater or umbrella, and for once, the widget is correct: the weather is lovely all day.


MONTAG SHORT FICTION #001
MONTAG publishes curious short fiction that explores our strange future and what it will feel like when we get there. The stories are outré and atypical; they're also closer to our today than you think.

I was here, in my synthfoam chair, but I was also there at the turning of the thousandth year since the ERA, the Eve of Retinal Augmentation. I witnessed an entire millennium's worth of glorious celebrations through the eyes of my kin without moving an inch from my position. Aerial pyrotechnics flew through the sky all over the State, bursting with joy, and it seemed like the entire planet celebrated for us lucky few. Explosions studded the atmosphere with rhinestones, and I saw the orb of our bedazzled planet, simultaneously the size of a glittering bauble in front of me and then exceeding my field of vision, the sky-scale projection somehow even larger than I remembered the sky itself. The faces of the Visionaries, blinding us with smiles and eyes twinkling with hope for the future, wreathed in gold, silver, and platinum stars, filled the sky and blessed us with music and light, raining wishes of health, wealth, and happiness upon us. We are one people, because they gave us the gift to see through each other’s eyes.
I was here, couched in synthfoam, far from harm, but I was also there. I saw through the eyes of my kin, as they were discovered and subsequently persecuted by some who felt threatened by our existence. When other States realized that we all could see through the eyes of one, they sought to destroy us. They feared that we were spies, and began to capture and torture us, trying to figure out how to debilitate our sight. During the first of these incidents, it was the only thing beamed on the Retinal News Network for an entire day and night. I remember “LIVE” in neon green scrolled across the bottom of my field of vision for the entirety of the stream, a testament to our will to survive. We grew more secretive, separated from the other States, and advanced as one people in the shadows of their civilization.
I was here, in the same place, but I was also there when my child was born. I saw through the eyes and the hands of the medical assistant robot who assisted my spouse in the birthing center. My spouse was not there. Her retinal implants were buzzing with static, a sign that she was receiving brain stimulation directly through her optic nerve allowing her to dissociate completely from her body and feel no pain. Her status, hovering in the right corner of my vision, was set to “Away.” I took control of the hands of the medical assistant robot after it lifted my son free from her body, and activated the process of severing his umbilical cord. My son, crying with eyes screwed up tight, could not yet witness the full beauty of this world, unaugmented as he was, and as he drew gasping, crying breaths to deeply fill his new lungs with air, he slowly blinked open milky blue eyes. I let the medical assistant’s autocontrols take over as another bot wheeled my partner to a recovery bay. Through the eyes of the medical assistant bot, I watched it carry my son to the natal initiation center, issue his identification chip, and then shine red lasers into his sightless, staring eyes. A stream of nanomachines swam down each beam of light to take residence atop the retina, assembling themselves into a microscopic viewer and connecting to the Network. The red laser changed to green, signaling a successful implantation, and I released a breath of relief. I received a notification in the top right corner of my vision that Harold would be delivered to our habitat in one hour by State Transport Of Retinabled Kin, and another notification followed immediately: I could now see through the eyes of my child. As the medical assistants continued to perform the final tests of health and wellness, I connected, passed genetic authorization, and was allowed access to his feed. The world seemed brighter through new eyes.

"Literature is the expression of a feeling of deprivation, a recourse against a sense of something missing. But the contrary is also true: language is what makes us human. It is a recourse against the meaningless noise and silence of nature and history." – Octavio Paz
To discern how literature as an art form has been changed by technology depends on defining literature in a certain way: that it is a series of words, printed in ink on paper, meant to be read from beginning to end.
Even before the computer, as digital media scholar Janet Murray has written in Inventing the Medium, authors like Jorge Luis Borges were using non-linear narrative constructions to create hypertext fiction.
Today we'll look a platform that has irrevocably changed our relationship to words, their function and form. On Twitter, the "meaningless noise and silence," can be overwhelming, but the strict restrictions (more on how strict they really are later), have created a new literary genre; and within this new format people are telling new kinds of stories, sharing perspectives that aren't often heard through printed literature, or couldn't be expressed in a traditional format.
Twitter and the Bard
Infinite monkeys
When discussing algorithmic compositions of great works of literature it's hard to avoid the infinite monkey theorem, that is that given all of the time and space of the infinite universe, surely a countless number of monkeys randomly hitting buttons on countless typrewriters, would eventually produce the complete works of William Shakespeare.
To update the infinite monkey theorem, one can easily imagine those countless monkeys on smartphones instead of typewriters and posting to Twitter.
In fact, there is an @Infinite_Chimp, but it's the name of an urban winery that, according to their website, sells gourmet wine in a can.
And there is a Twitter account set up for the express purpose of finding the complete works of Shakespeare amongst the Tweet stream. @CompleteTweets was created as a collaboration between the Globe theater in London and Twitter in 2016. According to The Verge, they hooked up a typewriter sitting in the Globe's lobby to an algorithm that searched Twitter word by word to type out all of Shakespeare's 37 plays and 154 sonnets in order.

I'm typing The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, word by word, one Tweet at a time. #Shakespeare400 https://t.co/uxENhdOyZR— CompleteTweets (@CompleteTweets) May 5, 2016


On December 6, 2016, it tweeted the final line of Hamlet, "The rest is silence."
Iambs are back


Pentametron's egg-and-Shakespeare icon

@Pentametron is a bot that was created by Ranjit Bhatnagar, a Brooklyn-based artist who works with interactive and sound installations, scanner photography, and internet-based collaborative art.
It finds tweets that are written in perfect iambic pentameter, which for those who haven't brushed up their Shakespeare recently is a line of verse with five sets of iambs (pairs of triplets of stressed or unstressed syllables). They're quite easy to write by accident. (That sentence could qualify).
Joined in March of 2012, the Pentametron continues to retweet unwittingly iambic pentametric phrases, from the mundane: "at least the yankees doing something right" to the philosophistic: "the empty vessels make the greatest sound ."
Over time, Pentametron has collected so many lines of iambs that they were enough to compose a 252-page "novel" entitled "i got a alligator for a pet!". While the length of the debut novel by the bot is impressive, its shorter literary works such as "song of the year okay okay okay" are more unexpectedly touching:

It's been a year, and nothing is the same.
I kinda lost myself along the way.
We want the money middle finger fame!
song of the year okay okay okay

No future
Ranjit Bhatnagar, who made @Pentametron, also created a bot called @thesefutures for Terraform, a peripheral of Vice's Motherboard. @thesefutures functioned by retweeting future speculation and assembling its own prophecies from phrases by writers and future-thinkers like David Byrne, Don DeLillo, and Elizabeth Moon.
It ran from October 2015 to its last retweet on November 9, 2016. Most of the content for November 8th and 9th referenced the US election, and the fact that @thesefutures expired on this day is either a grim coincidence, a political statement, or both.
Twitter and fiction
I have eaten the baby shoes
Because of the creativity it requires to work within the constraints of the Twitter format as a writer, it has a sort of strange love affair with literature.
There are several literary references that regularly circulate as meme formats on Twitter, the two most notable being William Carlos Williams' poem "This Is Just To Say," and Ernest Hemingway's (debatably attributed) "baby shoes" story.
There is even a @JustToSayBot that creates new versions of the poem following the formula "I have eaten the (plural noun) that were in the (noun) Forgive me They were (adjective) so (adjective) and so (adjective)."
Both this poem and the "baby shoes" story are often used as an example of how evocative brevity can be in English literature classes, and have become something of an inside joke on Twitter as a reference to the platform's format.
One writer has gone so far as to acquire the handle @babyshoes and assure it will never be used. It is unknown whether the same person owns the similarly blank babyshoes Instagram profile.
In response to the lifting of the 140-character limit for certain Twitter users in late September of this year, one user, @jrobertlennon used the story to demonstrate how the increased character limit could be abused:
Hi so I'm calling about the baby shoes? Are they still available? Great! I just had a baby and, you know, haha, baby needs a new pair of shoes! Anyway, so are they, like, NEVER worn? Or just, like, near mint? OK, great. Like, can I ask why—like, your baby didn't like them, or di— J. Peter Maldonado (@jrobertlennon) September 27, 2017

And of course, because this is Twitter and we can never have enough of a good thing, there are multiple "baby shoes" versions of "This Is Just To Say." The most popular one has approximately 20,000 likes:
I have eatenthe baby shoesthat were inthe iceboxand which Imistook forshoe-shaped plumsForgive methey were so smalland never worn— SCARE😱AMUCCI (@BobbyPines) October 10, 2017

Shorter, sweeter
Acknowledging the creativity that can come out of the limitation of writing in 140 characters and the use of the Twitter feed itself as a source of inspiration, Twitter sponsored a fiction festival in 2009, which took place annually ending in 2015 (according to the lifespan of its official Twitter account).
During these festivals, well-known authors would try to write an entire novel in a Tweet. The Guardian collected some of their best examples from 2012:



Microblogging fiction, as defined by its unverified and multiple-issue carrying Wikipedia page, is "a fictional work or novel written and distributed in small parts, defined by the system it is published within."
While few believe that most of Twitter's content is intentional or unintentional literary genius, Melissa Terras, a professor of Digital Humanities from London, has compared criticism of Twitter literature (or Twitterature) to resistance to any other new literary medium.
"In the Victorian era, critics were aghast when production press technology became more advanced and allowed authors to write longer novels. 'You had all these critics saying, "The books are too long, they’re awful"'" – via Quartz, "Authors are turning Twitter into a literary genre, 140 characters at a time"
Matt Stewart, author of a book on the French Revolution, released it in a series of 3,700 Tweets in 2009, and claims to be the first to publish a book through Tweets. However, Japanese "cellphone novels," or "keitai shousetsu," told through text messages, are arguably the first iteration of the form, and have been best-sellers since the early 2000s.
In 2010, Chinese author Zhong Xiaoyong (pen name Lian Yue) tweeted his novel "2020," using the platform to also make a statement about online censorship in China.
Many authors use the structure of the platform in creative ways, not simply posting the text of their stories but also making accounts for characters that interact, link to external web pages, and take full advantage of the hypertext format by constructing something similar to an alternate reality game.
For one example, as part of the Twitter fiction festival in 2014, Elliott Holt told a story on Twitter through retweets from characters who witness a murder at a party and Tweet about it, and whose Tweets are later used as part of the investigation.
Another notable example is Jennifer Eagen's "Black Box," released as a Tweet stream by The New Yorker in 2012. It works well broken up into short chunks because the story is comprised of the internal narrative of a female secret agent in a future where cartilage-embedded recording devices, cameras activated by tear ducts, mind-reading activity logging, and other technologies that have turned her body into a weapon are commonplace – as are ordinary people being outfitted with these technologies and deployed against foreign powers.
In 2014, David Mitchell Tweeted an experimental novel entitled "The Right Sort." In interviews with Mitchell at the time, he admitted it was primarily a PR stunt to draw attention to The Bone Clocks which was also released that year.
Ian Crouch wrote for The New Yorker, "By Sunday night, you could go to Mitchell’s Twitter page and read it from the bottom up; or else you could follow a link from Sceptre Books, his publisher in the U.K., and read the tweets, reorganized for easier scrolling, from the top down."
Even the publishing formats of long-form Tweets have changed since 2014, and savvy Twitter users today now thread their Tweet screeds into a readable order in the form of replies to the original tweet. What was once seen as a highly experimental use of the platform has now been codified and made more legible by conventions agreed upon by mass use.

The reality of Twitter is stranger than fiction

Maybe it's another side effect of the normalization of microblog fiction as a literary genre that Twitter no longer runs its annual competition.
This could be because the reality of Twitter is stranger than fiction, the combination of telepathy and Tourette's syndrome that somehow compels us to shout our deepest thoughts and feelings into the void, and constantly be reading and receiving those thoughts from people we may never come in physical contact with.
Or perhaps Twitter literature isn't disappearing, and there's actually more fiction on Twitter than ever. As the line between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred on social media, we are all the authors of a certain kind of Twitterature, telling the stories of our lives 140 characters at a time.

Finding someone to love is hard, and it isn't cheap either.
According to an annual survey by Match.com, the annual amount an unmarried person spent in the last year on dates was $1,600, and the "Dating Services" industry itself, including Match Group (which owns Match.com) and eHarmony, among other phone, internet, magazine, and newspaper matchmaking services (apparently those still exist), has surpassed 3 billion dollars of revenue.
And like most things in our modern world that take a lot of money and a lot of time to perfect, technology is making it... well, actually more complicated, instead of easier.
Most people have an idea of the type of person they want to be with, but a recent study by behavioral economists Stephen Whyte and Professor Benno Torgler showed that in online dating, these checklists go out the window.

What if technology could analyze every aspect of you as a person, from your childhood to your genetic makeup, and determine your perfect match? How much would you pay to meet that person?
With the constant surveillance of technology, and the amount of data collected on individuals, it shouldn't be hard to put two and two (or one and one) together. China recently started requiring that its citizens register with their national ID number on dating sites, which connects them to data about literally everything they touch: their locations, consumer behavior and credit score, online speech, and everything else. Instead of seeing this as a dystopian nightmare of lack of privacy, why not see it as an opportunity for technology to do something good (for once)?

Unfortunately, no one has figured out the algorithm of love yet, but there are some great examples in media and some not-so-great examples from the love lives of men on the vanguard of technological innovation that give us hope for the future of dating in the digital age. Could technology make it cheaper, faster, and easier to find love?
Black Mirror provides us with a lot of fodder for our "what if technology... but too much?" musings here at MONTAG, but only in its third series' episode San Junipero, did it show us for the first time a future with technology that brought people closer together, instead of isolating, torturing, and/or murdering them. Series four had its own heartstring-pulling episode, Hang The DJ, and if you don't want spoilers for either episode, stop here.
In both, technological interventions provide a basis for people unexpectedly falling in love within a simulation. In San Junipero, which won two Emmy awards last year, it's through technology that allows people to upload their consciousness to a virtual vacation town, to continue living in a simulation as young and healthy versions of themselves past illness and death.


via GIPHY

Similarly, in Hang the DJ, the couple is also inside a simulation, but the nature of their reality isn't revealed until the very end of the episode. In this program, they have literally nothing else to do but go on dates and form relationships of varied durations with people assigned to them by an all-knowing artificial intelligence system to find their perfect match. When the system fails to pair them up for life, they rebel and break through the simulation, revealing that 998 out of 1000 times the dating app has run the scenario forcing them apart, they perform the same act of rebellion. What feels like years of algorithmically-driven dating and misery turns out to have taken place in the space of a few seconds inside both of their smartphones as they meet at a bar IRL.



While the majority of viewers laughed or cried with happiness at this conclusion, critics at Wired and Mashable took umbridge with the happy ending's portrayal of the future of digital dating. Devon Maloney points out in the former that while San Junipero makes it easy to believe a virtual happily ever after could be possible, Hang the DJ's simulation, which doesn't take into account variables like work, family, and concerns outside of a romantic relationship, is still being performed by all of us at the rate of one lifetime per lifetime. Peter Allen Clark in the latter characterizes the final plot point of the app getting it right as a missed opportunity to delve into the potential horrors of online dating taken to the extreme.
The totalitarian environment that Hang the DJ's couple finds themselves in is reminiscent of the 2015 film The Lobster, in which single inhabitants of a dystopian city are sent to a hotel to pair off in a similarly stifling and unromantic way. The environment of both lacks overt hostility, and a degree of luxury permeates the living spaces. Vulture's Kathryn VanArendonk called it a "world-sized West End catalogue," and she isn't wrong. There's something to be said for the unreality of dating in a world where you don't have anything else to do except swim, play squash, walk through beautiful parks, and inhabit a series of perfect cottages. Who knows how their real selves, meeting in a bar blasting The Smiths, will actually react outside of the perfect simulation environment.
In real life, if a dating app or algorithm were designed to match people together and quantitatively judge their interactions to find their perfect match, the question becomes how to create a setting in which human interactions can be analyzed to this degree without having them feeling more like lab rats than love bugs.


via Huffington Post

The founder and ex-CEO of Rosa Labs, the company that proudly quantified the only other thing besides sleep that is better than romantic love (food) into a soulless paste, has some ideas about optimizing the dating environment with technology. Originally published on his now-defunct personal blog, Rob Rhinehart's "Engineering The Perfect Date" is a great example of the potential for technological overcomplication. While it seems to have been written as a satire, aspects of the automation of the mate selection process are eerily plausible.
As they say, time is money, especially in the tech world. So here's Rhinehart's formula for spending the least amount of time possible "dating," for maximum results:

Pull Tinder API data for facial analysis of subjects with OpenCV
Use natural-language processing to ensure a "meat-for-sex" arrangement via text (i.e. a dinner date)
Schedule dinner with virtual assistants, Yelp analysis of cost and quality, and OpenTable API
Send a Double Robot (i.e. a rolling iPad on a stick) pre-loaded with conversational topics to the date
If date is successful, pay via app and use Uber to deliver the date to an automatically booked AirBnB
Date arrives at AirBnB with Spotify playlist curated by their Facebook likes
Instacart delivers wine and strawberries
Exec delivers an EEG headset and compatible vibrator, which is connected to the Double
???
The experience is recorded on a GoPro and uploaded for review via Amazon cloud services
Uber is called the next morning, an e-card is delivered 3 days later, and continuing interaction with the subject's social media profiles is automated

This is the world we really live in: instead of using technology to get to know each other on a deeper level or test our bonds, it makes the experience of meeting and being intimate with people completely interchangeable. What could be personalized, becomes anonymized to an absurd degree.
And if you really want to save time, don't bother with all of that algorithmic matching or looking for love nonsense. Just let one of these robots swipe for you and then go throw your phone in the ocean.

Released in the same year as Youtube and Facebook, and just after the first season of The Apprentice foisted Donald Trump onto the world, 2005’s Idiocracy has become a sort of culty shorthand reference point for today’s ills. At the time, it was a famous flop. Now, it is regarded as a cultural soothsayer.
The movie depicts - hilariously - the USA, 500 years in the future, where society is so reliant on automated technology that independent thought is no longer needed. The world is barely functioning yet placates itself on a diet of fast food, sexualised omni-#content, and branded-everything.
Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph play an Joe, an amiable but lazy soldier who ranks at exactly the peak of the bell curve in every army test, and Rita, a sex worker who, in the hoary (geddit?!) old movie tradition, has street smarts and a heart of gold beneath her steely exterior.
Their staggering averageness means they are selected to take part in a suspended animation experiment that goes wrong - and after spending 500 years asleep by mistake, awake to save a humanity that has become deeply, unabashedly stupid.
As Idiocracy depicts a USA where branding is so prevalent that the stars on the Presidential Seal are replaced with the Carl’s Jnr logo, we’ll grade the comparisons between the American idiot dystopia of 2505 and the American idiot dystopia of 2018 out of five stars ⭐️.
Adult Intelligence -  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
Idiocracy’s central premise has been criticised by some people who believe that by depicting dumb people reproducing faster than smart people and as a consequence, creating a world of dumbasses, the movie thus advocates for, erm, eugenics.
While the opening scene’s very broad depiction of class, cultural differences and the consequences of them (poor dumb people breed like rabbits, smart wealthy people are too focussed on their careers to have kids) does indeed feel like a crass collection of redneck stereotypes, in MONTAG’s opinion, overall, Idiocracy doesn’t mock stupid people as much as it offers a scathing rebuttal to the cynically negative influence of big business, TV, and advertising on society.
After all, this is a movie by Mike Judge, the man who created Beavis and Butthead, the sofa-bound idiots who comment inanely on dumb TV, so the negative correlation between media and advertising with intelligence is in some ways his métier.



Joe’s utterly average 2005-era intelligence means that, in 2505, he can ace the most advanced intelligence tests - “if you have bucket that holds two gallons, and another that holds five gallons, how many buckets do you have?” - and is thus declared the most intelligent human on earth.
There is an uncomfortable truth lurking in the movie’s main idea: studies show that poverty, social background and the existing education levels of parents have a measurable effect on the literacy skills of their children: underinvestment in education to the people who need it most has a sad cascading effect through the generations.
Today, American adults have a low (and declining) reading proficiency, with 21 percent of adults in the U.S. reading below a 5th grade level. The sole positive of this utterly depressing fact is that the egos of these people will not be damaged by the withering analysis of one journalist - “about one in seven [American adults] are saddled with such low literacy skills that it would be tough for them to read anything more challenging than a children's picture book” - as they probably won’t be able to read the article.
And money does not alway equate to being smart. According to his own staff, President Trump is “an idiot” who has the actions and understanding of “a fifth or sixth grader.”. But we’ll discuss President Very Stable Genius more (much, much more) later…
TV and Advertising -  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️



Idiocracy’s 2505 is a world of ultra-powerful brands and media who have complete control over the thoughts of humanity. TV channels include The Masturbation Network™ - “Keeping America ‘Bating For 300 Years.” Magazines include “Hot Naked Chicks and World Report”, a publication with the headline “SHIT SUCKS,” and a list of issue highlights that reads like today’s XXX website keywords: “Chicks, sex, naked, world, sex, hot, report, chicks.”
On TV, the highest-rated show is “Ow My Balls” and features exactly what you would expect: a man repeatedly suffering testicular trauma in increasingly ludicrous ways (falling from a balcony onto telephone wires, legs akimbo, before being bitten by a dog, and then hit in the groin by a wrecking ball, etc).
(This writer, having spent hundreds of hours watching Jackass, is happy to admit that he is in no position to either condemn “Ow My Balls” or even suggest that he would not be keen to watch the “Ow My Balls” box set; and furthermore, he notes with interest that on Youtube, videos with titles like “2017 Funniest Nut Shot Montage” videos regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of views.)
Meanwhile, advertising and branding are all-pervasive, leveraging their wealth into ever-influential positions, and have simultaneously dumbed down in order to appeal to the public’s most base impulses. FedEx is now the adult-oriented FedExxx, TGI Fridays has become TJO’Handjobs and restaurant chain Fuddruckers is, with an amusing yet shuddering inevitably, now known as ButtFuckers.
One wonders what the future holds for the Federal University of Santa Catarina’s Institute of Oriental Studies.

Above, The actual logo for Federal University of Santa Catarina’s Institute of Oriental Studies
In Idiocracy, brands have made inroads into people’s subconscious. Gatorade-like drink Brawndo - “the Thirst Mutilator” - has become so pervasive that not only has it replaced fresh water (drinking fountains are plumbed to a Brawndo supply, farms sprinkle Brawndo over crops), but the brand’s slogan - “It’s got electrolytes” is a default response to any challenge to Brawndo’s authority, with Joe’s requests for drinking water being met with quizzical looks and exclamations of “Water? Like out of the toilet?”



Today’s brands are not beyond embracing stupidity to re-vitalise their products, and current trends in food product idiocy seem to centre around combining unhealthy things, in defiance of health, taste and reason.
KFC, in an attempt to make a burger dumb enough to engage a demographic of people racing to get heart disease, created the 600+ calorie Double Down, a burger where the bread is replaced with fried chicken. When launched, KFC sold 10 million of them in just over a month.
And while its life was mercifully brief, the Jimmy Dean Chocolate Chip Pancakes & Sausage on a Stick was a very real thing that could be bought in supermarkets across America.
It’s hard not to conclude that brands have take over in 2018. In a time where being an Instagram Influencer is a highly desirable “job”, people are behaving like brands. Brands, on the other hand, behave like people, in order to connect in an artificially #relatable way. Fast food outlet Denny’s is now tweeting stuff like this which manages to combine social media, deliberate vitality, high-fructose corn syrup, and a LOL, WTF ¯_(ツ)_/¯ take on society’s woes, all wrapped up in one monetisable, KPI-busting advert.
Politics  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
Sadly, this is the simplest comparison of all, and it’s the most depressing. Let’s keep this brief and then we can move on.
In Idiocracy, the democratically elected Commander In Chief is President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho, a former pro wrestler and porn star, who rules autocratically on the whims of his pumped-up ego, and has surrounded himself with yes-men and women with large breasts.
In 2018, the democratica… oh, do we even need to do this joke? Let’s just note that the only difference is that, until the emergence of the hotly-anticipated Pee Tape, we can’t full qualify Donald Trump as a porn star, but his attitude towards women is of a similar level of reprehensibility as most mainstream porn, and his predilection for adult movie stars, like 2018’s true queen, Stormy Daniels, is well documented.
Other similarities are similarly exasperating. In 2505, the Secretary of Energy is a teenage boy who won a contest to get the job. Given that President Trump appointed Rick Perry as head of the Department of Energy - a man who could not remember the department’s name, is a climate change sceptic, and doesn’t seem to know what the department actually does - maybe a horny teenage idiot would be a better choice.
Finally, in the movie, “the Brawndo Corporation simply bought the FDA and the FCC enabling them to say, do, and sell anything they wanted,” and in a USA where food companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying regulators to shape food guidelines that leave health experts exasperated, this notion does not feel too far from the truth either.
Urgh. Five stars.
Automation and identity  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️



Idiocracy depicts a near-fully automated world, which has lead to people becoming so reliant on technology, they can’t figure things out for themselves. This reveals itself to Joe when he visits the cigar-chomping Dr Lexus, whose interpretation of the results from the automatic diagnosis machine doesn’t extend beyond, “it says on your chart that you’re fucked up: you talk like a fag and your shit’s all retarded… but there are plenty of ‘tards out there living kick-ass lives.”
Let’s be clear - today’s American adults are not this clinically stupid, despite plenty of evidence from the emptiest vessels on social media. But US adults do compare badly to the international average in a series of intelligence tests.. Most interestingly, this low score is a trait of number of highly-technologically-reliant societies: the more you rely on tech, the less you need to use your brain. Once again, your parents were right: all that TV really is rotting your brain.
Back in 2505, and full automation means that all adults need to be registered to a central network, and people can be recognised by machine scanning their unique barcode tattoos. Joe, hesitating while undergoing the registration process, becomes permanently and officially renamed Not Sure.
Today, in China, where facial recognition technology is near-universal, hundreds of millions of CCTV cameras watch and recognise everyone, tracking and predicting their every move. In one experiment, a BBC journalist lasted just seven minutes “on the run” from police, who tracked him down and intercepted him almost immediately.
Being known universally as “Not Sure” is probably a preferable life than one in which you are living in an open prison.
OVERALL: 3.75 ⭐️ out of 5
Idiocracy’s supposed prescience is actually a fairly simple extrapolation of the corrosive effects of hyper-branding, invasive advertising, style over substance, and race-to-the-bottom media content that were already obvious in the pre-social media era in which it was made. At the time of release, reviews noted these hysterically surreal extrapolations with a kind of wry distance, but in a post-social-media world where it really does feel like attention is being doled out to the loudest and most controversial idiots, it’s easy to see why Idiocracy has gained a reputation as a societal warning.
For those concerned by the presence of President Trump nudging soft toys around in the White House play-pen, the movie actually offers a route out of the madness. Idiocracy ends on a positive note, as Joe and Rita both overcome their innate laziness and use their intellect to save the world: the everyman and everywoman waking up from a cultural stupor and realising they are smart and capable enough to overturn the status quo.
Maybe Idiocracy is a useful analogy after all…

As anyone who's observed their heart rate spiking on their Apple Watch (hey, you can rent one here) knows, blood plays a big part in our vitality.A lot of what we do to "keep young" is to do with blood: exercising to get it flowing, eating well to avoid clogged arteries, taking aspirin to keep the blood nice and thin.
So what if the key to a long life involved blood - but just not your own? Joe Sparrow finds out that in the search for youthfulness, researchers may have found a magic potion: young people's blood...

Modern-day billionaires don’t come much more interesting than Peter Thiel.
He co-founded one internet monolith (Paypal), spotted the early investment potential in another (Facebook - you may have heard if it), created a data company that nosey government agencies love (Palantir - even if you've not heard of it, they've probably heard of you), and, as a consequence, is filthy stinking rich.
Money brings you a lot in life, but if home-spun wisdom has taught us anything, it’s that “you can’t take it with you.” Peter Thiel, according to some tasty media stories, is eager to push that final destination as far away as possible.
And to make what he wants in life to happen, Peter Thiel is thirsty: thirsty for what he sees as justice (he paid to defend Hulk Hogan’s case in court against Gawker Media, which eventually was crushed to smithereens) but also thirsty for young people’s blood.
via GIPHY
It's all resulted in some... intriguing headlines.

Peter Thiel Is Interested in Harvesting the Blood of the Young

Or he’s not, according to which outlet you read:

No, Peter Thiel is not harvesting the blood of the young

Hey, hang about a minute...

Peter Thiel Is Very, Very Interested in Young People's Blood

Hmm. I guess the story you believe depends upon whether, in your opinion, a Trump-supporting Libertarian billionaire would consider harvesting youthful human blood a prudent investment.
Either way, whether he really does, as Gawker reported, “spend $40,000 per quarter to get an infusion of blood from an 18-year-old based on research conducted at Stanford on extending the lives of mice,” or not, Thiel is, as usual, onto something.
If you’re being mocked by the hit TV show Silicon Valley, you may or may not be crazy, but at the very least you are definitely on the bleeding edge.

Either way, in the centre of the Venn diagram between cutting edge technology, billionaires' eagerness to tweak their bodies, and the sticky red stuff, something bloody interesting is definitely going on.
So what will the future hold for BloodTech? And what does it mean for us non-billionaire normies?

First Blood, Part II
So why the focus on blood? Surely the possibilities offered by re-growing and replacing human organs or simply living forever offers greater impact - after all, we’ll all need a new liver or heart or kidney at some point.
But it turns out that blood is sloshing with a huge number of enzymes and molecules that do miraculous things - the consequences of which we are only just getting to grips with.
Blood isn’t just endlessly replaced red gloop - it gets old too. And as it gets old it gets less useful. And when blood stops being useful, you stop being alive. And that’s, you know, a problem.

“Young Blood” may sound like the name of an identikit SoundCloud rapper (actually, Young Blood really is a hip-hop artist on SoundCloud, and is worth a listen) but the idea of squeezing in a quart of someone else's plasma is worthy of your attention.
On a very basic but important level, young blood = young body parts. Scientists thought that as bones get older, they get worse at healing themselves - but it turned out that the bones could heal just fine: it was the blood that wasn’t doing its job.
And while the likes of Peter Thiel may (LAWYER'S NOTE: or may not) be getting transfusions from their Blood Boy, the most interesting part of this research – for the rest of us – is that the difference between old and new blood is just a molecule or two.
Find a way to reintroduce that molecule into the bloodstream and bones can heal themselves again, and we’ll all be youthful forever.

Young, at heart
None of this should be too shocking: the rejuvenating effect of young blood in old bodies was spotted in some lucky mice who were made young again in the 1950s.
But now there’s a dawning realisation that young blood’s eagerness to return organs to a similar state of youthfulness extends a bit further than giving aching muscles and bones a bit of pep: it might have beneficial effects on the brain.
This has enormous implications for people with brain-based conditions like Alzheimers and Parkinson's disease - two conditions that are notoriously difficult to treat.
Because if the secret sauce hidden in our most precious ketchup can bring withering brain cells back to vitality, millions of lives will be changed - and human trials are underway to see if young blood has an impact on muscle motor function.
via GIPHY
And just think: if a regular blood infusion could keep the body, the organs and the mind youthful, the more ambitious some post-human tech aims, like the computer-AI-brain interface proposed by Neuralink start to sound.
Neuralink is a pet project of yet another billionaire live-forever enthusiast – Elon Musk, the real life Tony Stark and old buddy of Peter Thiel (spotting a theme yet?) – and the combination of constant bodily rejuvenation coupled with augmented intelligence could be to tempting to let slip.
Not only will we live longer, but we’ll live smarter. It’s the startup dream, made flesh.

Thicker than water
For now, mysterious companies like Ambrosia are pushing ahead with pumping the good stuff into humans. Ambrosia is, according to Quartz, claiming some remarkable breakthroughs: *“a month after receiving a transfusion of young plasma… participants had fewer chemical biomarkers indicative of heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and certain types of cancers.”*
It sounds too good to be true (and indeed, has been called “fake news” by one Stanford immunologist) but right now, to a billionaire nearly the wrong side of 50, it is surely worth a punt.
So what does it all mean for the rest of us? Those other humans, who also have five litres of blood and an eagerness not to die yet, but very little in the bank? Essentially: sit tight and wait, bloodsuckers.
Much like how advanced tech is finding ways to turn the body's existing defences against cancer, our modern technology is discovering that the secret to a healthier future is right under our bleeding noses. And where there's an eagerness to keep living, there's cash, so any useful developments here will happen quickly - hopefully in our puny lifetimes.
In the meantime, as MONTAG’s Kathryn Lawrence found out, there is reasonable cash to be made from selling blood, and in these troubling economic times, maybe it’s as certain a business as a young person could hope for.

Rooting around the world of Biohacking will inevitably lead you to the question of ethics. In Part One, Sean Fleming discovered how, by wearing things like Apple Watches and fiddling with our personal fitness data means that many of us are already unwittingly Biohacking our bodies.
But beyond data, the next level of biohacking is intensely risky, but can bear life-chaning results: long-term illness eradicated, mental health restored. In Part Two, Sean learns how physical self-experimentation can begin with drugs, and reach as far as consuming someone else's poop...


“Most modern medical techniques don’t work, so you just expect me to deal with my symptoms for the rest of my life? That sounds wacko.”
– Josiah Zayner, biohacker extraordinaire


"Politics is politics and science is science and there's a bit of a tension between them sometimes."
– Professor David Nutt, former UK Gov Chief Drug Advisor


Do It Yourself
To some, Biohacking is more than working out that when you exercise you sleep better, or taking Modafinil makes you more productive. To these people, Biohacking means serious self-experimentation, and solving real world health problems that modern medicine has been unable to do so.
One of these serious dudes is Josiah Zayner. If the name rings a bell it might be for one of two reasons:
The first is his crowdfund aimed at providing people with CRISPR kits to alter bacterial DNA.
The second is the DIY faecal transplant he performed. On himself. And yes, a faecal transplant is pretty much what you’re hoping it isn’t.



*What is CRISPR anyway? This video explains all, whatever your level of understanding*.
Josiah has suffered from severe gastrointestinal issues for his entire life. His gut bacteria works against him on a daily basis.
Gut flora is a funny old thing. The microbial life in your belly dictates your gastrointestinal health, your weight, and even - potentially - your mental health. This mass of microbiotic genetic material - the microbiome - is so important to human life, it is considered a partner to our own personal genetic material.
Having tried and failed to alleviate his symptoms with conventional medicine, Josiah grew tired of his gut fucking with his life. He decided to give himself a new microbiome.

You are what you eat
The rationale behind Josiah's experiment was quite sound. If gut bacteria is responsible for your chronic pain, and transplanting your biome is a risky – yet within the realms of possibility – well, why not give it a go?
For all its intrigue, the experiment was fraught with hazards.
One is a very real biological danger: replacing his biome with a donor's means purging his body of all his existing bacteria so that the donor bacteria can ‘occupy’ Josiah’s body, effectively neutering his bacterial response.
The other is, simply put, gross: the experiment involved ingesting capsules of Josiah’s doner’s shit.


Josiah Zayner by Matt Biddulph CC BY 2.0

Ickiness aside, this was an incredibly risky move. Experts almost unanimously condemned Josiah’s experiment as dangerous and irresponsible. Less than 3% of faecal transplant donors are approved, and as a rule patients about to undergo transplants are told not to take antibiotics.
Of course Josiah went ahead and did it anyway. I guess if you feel you’ve spent your whole life being let down by doctors and health professionals, a few more negative opinions just lose their potency.
To cut a long and fascinating story short, Josiah’s experiment worked. His gastrointestinal issues are gone and he’s a lot happier for it.
I’d be pleased too if an incredibly risky procedure was successful and benefitted both myself and the wider scientific community. I’d be pleased if I had been vindicated after putting my life at risk to hack my health. I’m not sure how widely I’d share the news that I’d been eating poop, but that’s just me.

Microdose this!
You’ll be cheered to learn that not all biohacking involves rooting around in your friends poop and then swallowing capsules of it.
If you’re at all interested in how Silicon Valley tech mavens get shit done, you’ve probably heard the term microdosing before. Microdosing is taking very small quantities of drugs such as LSD, or Psilocybin (aka Magic Mushrooms), to boost productivity and creativity, lower stress, and stay happy.
The practice has attracted satire, obviously, but its roots go deep in the valley’s mythology, with both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates going on record saying they’ve taken and benefitted from tripping balls.



Furthermore, a cursory Google search will flag up endless personal accounts from entrepreneurs, programmers, creatives, and journalists who’ve all given it a go, to see if they can bottle lightning via some good old fashioned drug experimentation.
Dosing acid for creativity is nothing new. Albert Hofmann, the first person to synthesise LSD, believed that microdosing could be a valuable alternative to other more addictive drugs that contained amphetamines, and that it could increase focus and productivity.
Considering that LSD was created with these values in mind, it's unsurprising that people are discovering that acid isn’t just the plaything of Psy-trance festival-goers, and that it may have a place within the working environment.

The tripping point
Research into psychedelics was short-lived, but prior to its restriction James Fadiman was leading the charge and his research into psychedelics remains pioneering.
Fadiman’s something of a legend within the psychedelic research community - and as a lifetime advocate of the wonders of microdosing his is an opinion that carries weight in this field, so if you’re planning on riding the rainbow road to a better you let me share James Fadiman’s guide to microdosing.
There are some important but simple parameters. Simply take a small amount of acid, or psilocybin, regularly for about three days. "Small" means ⅕ to 1/10 of a normal dose. (Let’s save those bigger ones for Glastonbury, yeah?)



Fadiman reckons that taking LSD in the morning yields the best results, so after you’ve had a shower, put the kettle on, make yourself a cup of tea, and dose yourself over your cornflakes.
I would wash my hands prior to making breakfast but Fadiman’s position is unclear on this.
Like most biohacking, this is very much an at-your-own-risk experiment. Expect elevated moods, enhanced focus and productivity, and in some cases microdosers have reported it helping with depression and cluster headaches. Others have reported melting into the sofa and listening to Aphex Twin for 14 hours. You've been warned.
Look at me. I am the Doctor now.
Dismissing Biohacking, smart drugs, and lifelogging as niche play of the super-weird would be incredibly reductive.
For me, the early adopters who offer up their bodies to push this guerilla science further are the true innovators of our time. Society views single-subject research as the domain of the strange and the mad. Our literature reflects that fear: Dr Jekyll, The Invisible Man, The Lizard.
Self-destruction and villainy are nearly always thematically linked with the concept of self-experimentation, and yes, the ethics are wobbly and the risks are great – but playing it safe and pushing boundaries is an oxymoron.
Biohacking is moving us toward some of the most exciting preventative medicine and early warning systems. Look at today's biohackers and think about the future: those people inserting LEDs under their skin to mimic bioluminescence, placing magnets in their fingertips and speakers in their ears are just a few degrees of separation from us all inserting heart implants that warn of impending heart attacks.

As population age increases, health care services become strained, and greater emphasis is placed on individual responsibility for your own healthcare and wellness, it’s today’s hobbyists that become tomorrow’s industry.
Make no mistake, these pioneers of personal healthcare are paving the way for a new type of healthcare. Homebrewed, personal, and totally yours.
Now if you’ll excuse me, WedMD is telling me that this lump on my arm is Smallpox. I think I’ll figure out my own second opinion.

You've maybe looked at the latest affordable drones and thought something like, “Hey, I could make a great holiday video with that!” And you’d be right - because drones are amazing, right? But as well as providing great shots of you sipping sunset cocktails, they’re also ushering in an era of near-instant urgent healthcare...

In the not so distant future, instead of hearing the wail of ambulance sirens signalling that help is on the way when you or a loved one has a medical emergency, you may hear the sound of an unmanned aerial vehicle buzzing overhead.
Over 800,000 people per year in the EU suffer from cardiac arrest and only 8% survive because the window for effective care is so small: emergency services must arrive within 4-6 minutes to avoid brain damage or death. On a global scale, it’s estimated two billion people live too far from developed urban centers to receive medical care, and five million children per year die because they can’t receive medical supplies due to a lack of infrastructure and access to care.
A significant population of mothers die from postpartum hemorrhaging without access to blood transfusions because of how hard it can be to keep and transport fresh supplies of blood in remote areas. With a global commercial market for drone technology of over $130 billion, several groups of innovators have launched programs to deliver medical assistance via drone to support these remote communities, delivering medical care further and faster than ever before.
Alec Moment of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands created an Ambulance Drone to respond to heart failure, drowning, respiratory issues, or other traumas requiring immediate attention. The drone his team has designed at TU is a “compact flying toolbox” that can even fly indoors. It contains a lightweight defibrillator, CPR kit, and room to carry other medicines.




Because drones can arrive within one minute of a cardiac event, the survival chances jump from 8% to 80%

After an emergency call is placed, the drone can fly out to the location of the caller at 100 kilometers per hour, and when it arrives the emergency service operator who has been on the phone with the caller can communicate with them via video and voice through the drone.
Untrained civilians average a 20% success rate using a defibrillator, but with instruction by a medical professional overseeing the process they can succeed up to 90% of the time. Because the drone can arrive within one minute of a cardiac event, the survival chances jump from 8% to 80%. Air traffic laws in the Netherlands currently don’t allow for autonomous drones, but the developers are optimistic about them taking to the skies in 2023.
A similar project called HiRO (Health integrated Rescue Operations) has been launched by teams collaborating from William Carey College of Osteopathic Medicine and the unmanned aerial systems program at Hinds Community College in Mississippi, USA.
Their drones are also armed with supplies and enabled to connect civilians to a medical team who can deliver instructions via live video using Google Glass. They’ve been designed for deployment during terrorist or active shooter situations (more common in the USA than anywhere else in the world) or natural disasters, where first responders would be threatened or blocked by flood or fire.



The Stony Brook Global Health Institute from Stony Brook University in New York, along with the United States Agency for International Development, and the government of Madagascar are testing drones created by Varyu in Madagascar.
Varyu’s drones can take off and land vertically, and fly long ranges autonomously to deliver medical supplies such as antibiotics and vaccines, blood samples for tests of tuberculosis or HIV, and urgently needed blood transfusions. 70% of people in Madagascar live in rural settings so remote they can only be reached by foot, and now, by air.
Zipline, a drone startup out of San Francisco, has been cooperating with the government and medical professionals in Rwanda to deliver blood to 7 million people over 7,000 square miles. Rwanda is known as the “land of a thousand hills,” and during the rainy season, the roads flood and not even trucks can pass. Supplies can take 4-6 hours to arrive in small towns.

After blood or medicine is ordered via app or text message, drones can arrive within 15-30 minutes, flying up to 75 miles before recharging

With 21 blood transfusing facilities, the two-meter wingspan fixed-wing Zip drones can perform hundreds of deliveries per day, each carrying 1.5 kilograms of blood. After blood or medicine is ordered via app or text message, the drones can arrive within 15-30 minutes, flying up to 75 miles before recharging.
Zipline’s drones don’t even land: they drop their payloads via parachute. The drones have a map of every roof, tree, and clearing near the hospitals they deliver to, and calculate the trajectory of the parachute accounting for wind speed and direction before releasing it.
They then return autonomously to their delivery centers to be redeployed with their next shipment. After great successes making medical deliveries in Rwanda, Zipline intends to launch a similar program in Maryland, Nevada, and Washington, USA, in 2017.



Lifesaving drones are making a huge impact in underserved areas in Africa, and could be coming soon to replace ambulances in a town near you. Pending the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration, the future of urgent care is exciting: drones able to transport people needing medical care out of war zones, and drones with lightweight onboard cooling systems that could deliver human organs grown in pigs to hospitals in need of transplants.
The idea of drones saving your skin seemed like science fiction only a few years ago. But our future, as ever, gets weirder and more impressive as it rapidly moves onwards and upwards.

what is this



On July 5, 2017, Vox Media's sports-focused site SBNation published an article by Jon Bois entitled "What football will look like in the future – 17776."

Something is terribly wrong

The meta description for the article reads, "It's clear that the sport of football needs to change. And the $64,000 question, my friends, is simple: 'how?' Something is terribly wrong. The writing's on the wall: youth participation in the sport is down, thanks in large part to their parents' concern for their health. In recent years, the NFL ... "
The article with the slug "17776-football," however, does not contain an update on the impact of CTE research on the popularity of the gridiron game. Upon clicking the article and attempting to read the first paragraph, the words "Something is terribly wrong" repeat, expand in size, and eventually completely obscure the screen.
This is the portal to a hypertext fiction that racked up over four million page views as an increasingly devoted group of football fans and nerds alike checked for updates to the story over the next ten days.
An internet culture writer by the name of Dr. #Content has written a comparative analysis of 17776 with Jon Bois' earlier works for SBNation, many of which blur the boundaries of sports writing, fiction, and internet art.
Dr. #Content astutely draws out how across works like The Tim Tebow CFL Chronicles and Breaking Madden, Bois consistently delights in the futility of human progress. E.g., in 17776, humanity has achieved immortality, reached its technological apex, and has nothing to do but play increasingly bizarre iterations of the game formerly known as American football.
Across his work, Bois also plays with and questions the complexity of our ultimately inconsequential societal structures surrounding both work and play, and the asymptotic definitions of progress, society, work, and entertainment.



The first embedded video in 17776, "what year is it," establishes the world of the fiction by scrolling through all of the US Presidents until 2057, incrementing the year of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodall welcoming you to the opening of the NFL Draft through 3600, and panning through Google Earth and satellite images, as well as headlines dated from the early 20th century about the "future of football," before revealing the iconic image of the Statue of Liberty submerged in the sea up to her waist, over whose receding figure the space probes Pioneer 9, Pioneer 10, and JUICE (the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, scheduled for launch in 2022) are introduced in the style of a 90s sitcom.
It's #goals. It's a touchdown. He sticks the landing. Whichever sports metaphor you want to phrase it with, 17776 sucks you in: it's an enigma, an absurdity, but also a highly accessible diversion.
An instant cult classic
17776 had all of the necessary qualities to become an instant internet cult classic.
One possible explanation is its visually stimulating, unpredictable multimedia elements, with splashes of self-referential Web 2.0 aesthetic, which redefined the genre of hypertext fiction.
Add in the characters: the humans and non-humans are immediately likeable and somehow relatable, despite being 15,000+ year old immortals and nonbinary sentient space probes.
And the central concept's surrealist take on sports, entertainment, and human existence in a time, to quote Bois, "so far away that nobody ever thinks about it," is wildly imaginative in its creation of new forms of sports entertainment, while referencing the threats of global warming and existential stagnation often enough to not be pure frivolity.
The format and tone of the story drew comparisons to Homestuck, a multimedia web comic that ran for 7 years and is infamous for the rabidity of its fandom – another quality that 17776 now shares, after being published for only ten days.
A cosplay of JUICE appeared on Twitter a mere three days into the fiction, and as 17776 was released, Tumblr exploded with theories, art, and fanfiction, as well as despair about the series’s imminent end.

Juice - 17776 @jon_bois pic.twitter.com/sTKVaNMI6P— Kat (@KatSmilodon) July 8, 2017


17776 has its own subreddit, and its own fanfiction category on Archive Of Our Own.
10 months after the series' publication, the rate of fanart production has slowed, but there are still posts at least once a month on Tumblr, Reddit, or AO3 – including an automated JUICE-themed blog that posts the word "fart" once per day (JUICE's love of both Lunchables and rake-based slapstick, and general giving-no-fucks attitude quickly made the Jupter probe a fan favorite).
For a virtual experience with such a short run, its legacy is surprisingly strong. And as it approaches one year since its first publication, public attention to the story is expected to increase again.
For the love of the game
But it's no wonder the story became an immediate object of the internet's affection, as 17776 was explicitly made to be delighted in.
In an email to Poynter, Bois writes, "The goal as conceived was to give the reader a good time... That was literally the whole point."
He expanded on this in a Q&A published nine days after the series' end, in response to a question submitted by a fan about the choice to produce long-form fiction:

"I thought about some of the most popular long-winding stories our culture had produced in recent years — 24, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, etc. — and how miserable their worlds tended to be. Everything was going disastrously wrong, everyone was dying in horrible fashion. It was death worship. I really like some of those shows! But they are dread-porn.



I wanted a world to escape to once in a while, and it couldn’t be one of those. I didn’t want a utopia, by any means, but I wanted a world where I could dwell on things that were bizarre, fascinating, and maybe even funny. If I wanted that world, I thought, maybe some other folks out there want that too, and maybe it would make them happier by a fraction of a percent."

In the same Q&A, Jon Bois also cites Calvin & Hobbes as an inspiration, and there is definitely something to be said about playing Calvinball in the 17776 universe.
He also mentions The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, because "it is also about exploration for its own sake. You could get lost in that game forever without even bothering to achieve the main goal. (You might notice that nobody in 17776 ever scores a touchdown.)"
In her Medium article, "Jon Bois Set My Brain On Fire," Emma Phipps explains why the internet hungers for this kind of content and goes crazy for it when we get it. It's created without an ulterior motive. It isn't engineered for clicks and conversions. It's engineered for quirks, and for quality entertainment.
It's impossible to say whether speculation on the state of the world in 15,000 years will be accurate, and the plot points that humans mysteriously become ageless and that space probes gain sentience over this span of time are clearly not meant to be predictive.
It's not just the future of football, it's the future of fiction. It's exactly what you don't expect from SBNation, and that's why it's so fun. It's made for the love of the game.
What is the game, exactly? Maybe a better question is, what isn't?

We've been augmenting our bodies with technology for, well, ever, if you count clothing as technology. When you use your Apple Watch to make a voice call, it's a big step towards our bodies being the starting point we add useful equipment too.
So who has already added things to their body - and what do they do? Why did they do it? And bearing in mind the (sometimes aggressive) response to people sporting Google Glass in public, how will other non-augmented people feel about their super-human peers?
MONTAG's Kathryn Lawrence peers under the skin to find out what it takes to become a cyborg...

Extra Sensory Cyborgs
In the future, technology will give us extra senses that we can only dream of today. As it stands, our natural human senses are far inferior to those of other animals. Of course, what we lack in raw sense data, we can usually make up for with our much higher brain power, but that still doesn’t mean that we’ll ever smell as well as a dog, or see as many colors as a mantis shrimp.
Or maybe we can. With technology, anything is possible. These artists and scientists have hacked their own bodies to become cyborgs that have more senses than the average human being. Some of them are making up for deficiencies they were born with, and others simply want to see how far they can push the limits of what it means to be human.

Technologically Induced Synesthesia & Cyborg Art
If you aren’t familiar with synesthesia, it’s a rare psycho-physiological phenomenon that causes the senses to work in strange ways. Synesthetes automatically associate sounds with tastes, colors with numbers and words, smells with shapes, or any other pairing of sensory information. This involuntary cross-firing of the brain affects one in every 2000 people, with some experts suggesting that some mild forms affect one in 300.
Neil Harbisson has a form of technologically induced synesthesia. He was born with achromoplastia, and saw the world only in black and white until he was 21 years old. In 2004, he had an antenna implanted in his skull that vibrates corresponding to colors. He then feels these vibrations as sound frequencies inside of his head, including colors that human eye can’t normally perceive in the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum. These extra senses inform his art practice, and he talks extensively about the potential for this kind of technologically mediated synesthesia to revolutionize fashion, food, music, and other creative pursuits in his well-known Ted Talk.


But is he the “first cyborg artist” as some sources have claimed? Definitely not.
Stelios Arcadiou, also known as Stelarc, a performance artist born in 1946, has been augmenting his body with technology for much longer. Many of his performances have been extremely graphic in the way that he introduces technology to his body. For example, after two surgeries, he has had a third ear implanted on his arm with an embedded wi-fi enabled microphone inside, so that the ear can not only listen, but transmit sounds. He has also made performances with other, more conventional, cyborg apparatus such as a robotic arm and a massive exoskeleton.


Third Hand by Stelarc


Extra Sensory Perspectives
Moon Ribas, who is also a cyborg artist, has an augmentation that allows her to feel when there is an earthquake anywhere on the planet in real time. The implant under the skin of the inside of one of her elbows gets information from a custom iPhone app that aggregates data on seismic activity, and the strength of the vibration adjusts to translate the magnitude. She has described the sensation as “ akin to having a phone vibrate in your pocket,” and has had this extra sense for more than three years now.
She uses her seismic sense in her dance performances. In one piece called Waiting for Earthquakes, she remained still until prompted by the vibrations of the device to move. Very small earthquakes, much too minor to register for those of us without a constant stream of seismic sense data, happen approximately every 10 minutes.


Waiting For Earthquakes by Moon Ribas

Moon Ribas and Neil Harbisson are the co-founders of the Cyborg Foundation which advocates for the advancement of sense-enhancing technologies with the slogan “Design Yourself.” Along with the Cyborg Nest, which Moon is also a co-founder of, they promote technological augmentations and provide information and inspiration to aspiring cyborgs.
Cyborg Nest has developed the North Sense a $425.00 device which allows the wearer to sense magnetic north, a skill that many flying creatures such as birds and bats, already have. The sensor must be attached to the chest with two small titanium rods stuck under the skin, like a typical barbell piercing, and it vibrates gently when the wearer is facing magnetic north. It was designed to be an “entry level” cyborg device, as it doesn’t require surgery, and in fact can be installed by any licensed piercing studio.

Common Senses
The most accessible and common cyborg augmentation today is undoubtedly a magnet inserted in one of the fingertips. When the nerve endings in the finger heal from this minor surgery, they become sensitive to electromagnetic waves. Neodymium magnets are most commonly used, and must be coated with a body-safe material such as silicon so that metals don’t leach into the blood system.
Biohackers Grindhouse Wetware have created a more advanced version that uses the magnet to transmit more complex data, such as sonar or other fields of energy. Being able to sense electromagnetic fields alone, however, can be quite useful for people who work with electronics or electricity. And there are now hundreds of biohackers who have had this procedure.

Online retailers such as Dangerous Things and Digiwell sell body-safe magnets and implantable devices such as RFID transponders, which can be programmed to send all kind of information from inside of the body. One Swedish workplace is already using implanted RFIDs to let its employees open doors and use office equipment.

In the future, many have speculated we’ll be using implanted chips in the body instead of credit cards or IDs. An implanted chip could be used to store all of your medical records, for example. Market forces like using implanted technology for medical or financial purchases will most likely be what pushes this tech into the mainstream.
There will have to be a social function that necessitates having technology in the body for most people to accept it, and not just be an interesting – but ultimately personal and subjective – extra sensory perception.

Will there be money after the end of the world?
Whatever your personal fantasy of the end of civilization entails (natural disasters, pandemics, meteor strikes, nuclear war, or some other black swan theory), if humanity survives catastrophe with the memory of modern civilization, new currencies will most likely be established in the post-apocalyptic society.
Economists, doomsday preppers, crypto-anarchists, and others are already making their predictions, from gold and silver, to bartered goods, to bitcoins and bottle caps. Let's take a look at the future of cash.
Old money, new money
Along the lines of the cartoon fan theory that The Flintstones wasn't set in the Stone Age, but in the same world as the Jetsons after nuclear war, some are predicting that the post-apocalyptic world won't look much different from the premodern one.
In Belgian economist Henri Pirenne's Economic and social history of medieval Europe, he references the German economic concept of "Naturalwirtschaft," or "Natural economy," which references an economic structure similar to that of Europe in the Middle Ages, in which "the part played by money was then so small as to be almost negligible." This isn't to say that currency didn't exist, but so few people had it in meaningful enough amounts that it wasn't used as much as bartering or reciprocal trade systems.
The return to a natural economy of bartering in the post-apocalyptic future is one possibility that survivalists (also known as preppers, the folks who are stocking bunkers with canned goods and weapons right at this moment to prepare for when the Shit Hits The Fan (or SHTF), which stands for whatever their personal vision of societal collapse is) are looking forward to.

Throughout the prepper blogosphere, shopping lists abound of the types of things that will be more than worth their weight in gold (more on gold itself, later). As The Prepper Dome points out on their list "Six Kinds of Currency That Might Emerge After The Collapse,": you can’t eat gold. The list of six includes:

Salt: citing its use to pay Roman soldiers and its multiple medical and culinary uses
Fur: because in many countries squirrel pelts were essentially traded like dollar bills
Tobacco: it’s portable, addictive, and the modern use of cigarettes for bartering purposes is obvious
Knives: are portable, durable, useful, and were traded as currency in ancient China
Alcohol: can be used for fuel, preserving food, cleaning wounds, as well as being divisible and durable
Herbs and spices: particularly marijuana, since it can be eaten and used for medicine as well as grown for hemp fibers can be used to make rope, clothing paper, and fuel

Prepper Zine has a list of 25 barterables, including many daily hygiene items like soap and toothbrushes, as well as condoms, which are actually a survivalist staple: not only because bunker babies would definitely complicate your post-apocalypse plans, but because they have tons of non sexual uses. Other health-related items are also a great idea to stockpile, like painkillers, antibiotics, and bandages, since no matter how the infrastructure fails, it's likely that pandemics will follow.
Although The Prepper Journal predicts that ammunition will be traded like bullets for beans in the Wild West, others warn to never barter ammunition or firearms, for obvious reasons.
Silver, gold, and crypto
While the super-rich are buying land in New Zealand to ride out the apocalypse, the rest of us have to figure out whether we'll be able to get money out of banks or if we should start burying tin cans full of gold coins in our backyards.
The blog Off Grid Survival argues that cash will still be king following a crisis situation like a natural disaster, where they imagine credit and debit cards won't work, but you would still be able to throw small bills at a convenience store counter while filling your car with gas and grabbing some emergency jerky during a mass evacuation.
There are a few arguments against predicting a cash for gold economy in a world W.R.O.L. (another prepper acronym, meaning Without Rule Of Law). Forbes' "How To Doomsday Prep Like An Economist" advises that gold will be practically useless because of income effects: "A disaster bad enough to make developed nation currencies completely worthless is also going to absolutely obliterate the demand for gold because gold is a luxury and incomes will plummet." Others make the argument that while gold has more intrinsic value, silver is a better long-term investment.

According to an attendee of this year's Silver & Gold Summit in San Francisco, cryptocurrency advocates were out in full force promoting the idea that bitcoin could be the new gold. "Buy bitcoin" has recently surpassed "buy gold" in Google search results rankings, so it's clearly not only the experts who are thinking all that glitters is not.
There is still a perception amongst economists that bitcoin is for bad actors and is too unstable to be considered a serious investment. Jim Rickards, author of Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis, was quoted in an interview for Business Insider about gold versus bitcoin characterizing it as "a utility token for criminals, terrorists, money launderers, tax evaders." He believes the price is being manipulated, that the amount of energy required to mine cryptocurrency will soon hit a wall, and that the subjective value has yet to be tested against a recession or financial panic (much less doomsday).
Goldman Sachs also says bitcoin is not the new gold, but even though Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, said he would fire anyone who traded bitcoins, JP Morgan analysts have expressed the opinion that it could be.
For survivalists who believe they could still access or create enough electricity to power their own internet, bitcoin has the same appeal as gold in that it's self-banking and a finite quantity of it will exist, protecting against inflation and deflation. That is, unless quantum computing to create more advanced cryptocurrencies or asteroid mining to get more gold are features of the future.
Most bitcoin vs. gold investment comparisons (more reading from Coindesk and APMEX, who represent both sides) end up saying a diverse portfolio is best, and that there's no reason not to go for both as long as you aren't investing more than you can afford to lose. All of the above considered, do not rely on MONTAG Magazine for investment advice, because the last currency we're going to explore is totally fictional and made out of trash.
Bottle caps



In the 1950s-inspired post-nuclear world of the Fallout video games, you emerge from an underground bunker in the 22nd or 23rd century, and the currency of the land is bottle caps. Not just any bottle caps: Nuka-Cola bottle caps with 21 crimps and ridges.
According to the fans who run the Fallout Wikia and Gamepedia entry for Fallout, bottling manufacturers were lost in the Great War, a nuclear war that took place in the year 2077, and adoption of the caps happened between 2093 and 2103 in the city called the Hub. Because the facilities to produce them were lost, bottle caps made an ideal currency because they had a fixed supply, were difficult to counterfeit (though counterfeit coins do exist in the game), and were originally backed by bottles of water, an extremely valuable resource in the irradiated deserts.
When the preorder for Fallout 4 was announced, one industrious fellow who had been collecting bottle caps for over 7 years sent Bethesda Game Studios 2,240 bottle caps, 11.2 pounds of them, and while they did allow him to pay for a preorder in the game's currency, they also made it clear that they did not wish for the stunt to be repeated.
Analysis of this transaction by The Game Theorists, a YouTube channel that actually does the math on silly questions like how much fictional future video game currencies would be worth in real money, found the actual worth of 2,240 bottle caps by two different methods.
They first used calculations from the 2010 game Fallout: New Vegas, in which gold bars are sold for 10,539 caps each, and the price of gold per ounce in 1961 (based on the songs playing on the radio in the game's soundtrack), puts the price at $1.67 per bottle cap, which due to inflation would be $52 per cap today. So paying 2,240 bottle caps for a $60 video game preorder was overpaying by about $116,420.00.
However, using a second calculation, with the real world worth of bottle caps according to the value of carbon steel, it would take 57,142 caps to equal $1, so a $60 preorder should have cost 3,428,571 caps (he paid less than a tenth). The obvious calculation of how much he actually paid for the game brings the cap to dollar value at approximately 33 and 1/3 caps to $1.
So it may be impossible to predict, if our post-apocalyptic society chooses an arbitrary item like bottle caps as currency, what we should start hoarding now. It could be Starbucks plastic coffee stirrers, Keurig coffee capsules, or Bic pens. When the SHTF, the currency of the land could be bitcoin, gold, or bartered goods, but we won't know until after it happens. Maybe money won't matter at all, and all the economists, preppers, and bitcoin hoarders will be wrong. Maybe the most valuable thing we will have is each other.

Thanks to some truly unfortunate economic events and the internet, we're more aware of the limits of capitalism than ever before. And interest abounds in alternatives to our current economic system as people dream of a better way to economic happiness.
In countries like the UK, FTSE 100 bosses earn 120 times more than the average employee, while the average wage for British workers, when adjusted for inflation, fell by more than 5 per cent between 2007 and 2015.
People, who are notably Not Stupid, are paying attention to all this, and it’s not a huge surprise the stridently socialist economic agenda of politicians like Jeremy Corbyn are being seen as bracing alternatives.
Meanwhile, alternative economies are being discussed seriously by the Finest Minds Of Our Time in Silicon Valley.
It’s no coincidence that vocal murmurings are emerging from San Francisco, advocating that California breaks itself into pieces. One of them, coincidentally, grants Silicon Valley independence from the rest of the newly-formed states. Decide for yourself what the meaning of “alternative” is in this concept.
So while the UK wrestles over - amongst other things - whether to embrace or reject an alternative post-Brexit economy, MONTAG takes a look at whether there are true alternatives to our economic model - and if Capitalism is That Guy who always ruins the party. (Spoiler: pretty much).

Reasonable intent
Intentional communities take a sidestep away from capitalism. They also appear to work. In the US, Intentional Communities (a name chosen to distance itself from “Commune”, which is a little too close to “Communism” for a lot of people’s liking) are well-established and there are many of them - about a thousand scattered all over the country.
Twin Oaks Community seem to be onto something - the point of their Intentional Society is to “have fun”: a concept we can all get on board with. And all it takes is for members to make tofu or hammocks for 40 hours a week, share the land, tools and facilities that are used to create them, and then turn over all your earnings to the community. See? Totally not communism.
Snark aside, it seems to work. The community’s “Planners” determine the larger will of the community to decide where money gets spent, and everyone is happy with it. Members have free access to everything, including food, lodging, an outdoor sauna, a woodworking workshop, and free yoga classes.
Downsides? Dating is hard, especially after a few breakups - “sometimes the pool is exhausted,” one frustrated Lothario laments in this VICE documentary.
Intentional Communities are not really opting out of Capitalism: the money they earn comes from the outside world. But the way the community pools and uses it is a kind of Capitalism Filter: separating the good from the bad.
Except... the whims of Capitalism looms large over the nice people of Twin Oaks: if (or when) Whole Foods, one of their main purchasers of tofu, decides to pay less, Twin Oaks will have to roll with it, just like any other supplier.
It’s hard to not root for the plucky Twin Oaks Community - and they seem to be an example of how an alternative economy system can just about survive in the Late-Stage Capitalist frenzy.
But what happens when an altruistic, visionary and thoughtful Intentional Community gets huge, charges $500 a ticket and becomes the coolest holiday destination in the world?

Fire
The poster-child for alternative economies, Burning Man festival, has come a long way from its roots of a desert campsite filled with like-minded post-hippies, a party filled with big dollops of kindness and sharing, and a big old bonfire at the end of it all.
Today, it's reasonably similar, except that now about 70,000 attendees descend on Black Rock Desert in Nevada every year to party, and the concept of an alternative economy has mutated into a hot ’n’ hedonistic, ‘Gram-worthy lifestyle-vacation for the Silicon Valley set.
Burning Man’s Johnny-Come-Latelys are often eye-wateringly wealthy. Last year, model Suki Waterhouse posted some luxe photos of herself in one of Burning Man’s more luxurious tent towns: here she is being hand-fed oysters prepared by a top chef.
Wait - aren't these people the enemy? Can you be an alternative economy when the people taking part are from the extremities of the other economy?

Burning Man operates on some radical principles around community and participation. The first three principles are:
• “Radical Inclusion” - anyone can be part of Burning Man;
• “Gifting” instead of payment - and the act of giving does not require anything in return;
• “Decommodification” - which means no “commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising”.
Goodbye cash and #brands, hello social paradise.
But when a radical dream gets big, things change fast. Today, Burning Man has an airport for the ultra-rich which welcomes up to 800 flights a day.
In 2018, Burning Man is a fascinating example of an alternative economy colliding with hot, heavy, capitalist cash. There are still plenty of old-school Burners who truly live the Radical credo, of course, and it's technically possible that Paris Hilton adopted a new-found interest in decommodification as she helicoptered into the desert, but it is also possible that the presence of alternative-economy-tourists detract from the old-school vision.
    Taking off to #BurningMan 🚀 #LetsDoThis 🔥 #DragonflyDen A post shared by  Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Aug 30, 2016 at 7:06pm PDT 
While visitors to the festival might not be allowed to carry bricks of foldin’ money, the outside world has created a super-deluxe cashflow around them. Dressing to impress is an inherent part of the Burning Man experience and is an extension of your own persona.
But for the moneyed newcomers who are too busy to buy the requisite clothing (or, maybe, too busy working to have a unique persona) there are stylists who - quite rightly - take full advantage of them. It costs only $10,000 for clients to be dressed to look like a Burner “should” - albeit with that unmistakable sheen that only a bulging wallet can bring.
Burning Man itself is non-profit, but turns over a ton of money. In 2014, Burning Man earned about $30.6 million from ticket sales and an additional $200,000 from selling those two living-in-the-desert essentials: ice and coffee.
However you look at it, Burning Man’s principles are being challenged, and it’s hard to tell if that squeaking you can hear are the pips being squeezed, or the indignation of old-school Burners, aghast at the commodification of it all.

Yummy Homemade Popsicles
Where colossal commerce collides with collective community, squabbles abound. There are accusations that the wealthy camp-builders are happy to enjoy the partying bit, but less happy to uphold the gifting, decommodifying, ultra-equality part.
Fascinatingly, it was Burning Man Project board member Jim Tananbaum, and his camp, Caravancicle, who found himself at the centre of one of Burning Man’s most famous economic pickles.
Much of the squabbling over Caravanicle feels both petty and fundamental at the same time: was making entrance to the camp a wristband-only affair merely to ensure that guests are “gifted” food and drink, or is it an overt act of exclusion? Is doing something - like building the camp - in exchange for a wristband just bartering - AKA forbidden commerciality?
Jim was hurt by accusations that his camp had abandoned the principles that made Burning Man what it was, and responded online: “On Friday night, [we] used up all of our booze to gift a huge party for anyone who visited our camp. We regularly gifted very yummy homemade popsicles and herbal tea but were not able to set up the gift stand in front of the camp as originally envisioned”
His pain is palpable: “Referring to Caravancicle campers or members of any other camp as “the rich people” is creating a class system within Burning Man, which I don’t believe is beneficial to the community.”
Some Burners were less convinced. One commenter said that [sic], “the very first night I had a bartender willing to share a very delicious cocktail, so impressed I brought people from my camp the next night and was turned away (on tuesday) stating booze now for “guests” only. Everyone I know had similar experiences from that point on.”
Is Burning Man's newly swollen size and scope the point where "gifting" breaks? It’s not hard to imagine how normal schmucks, slurping on desert-warm tins of beer in a dusty campsite are attracted to the fancy boutique camp with “free” cocktails, Souk-themed yoga spaces, and supermodels milling around taking selfies.
And think about poor old Jim for a moment: if you’d sunk an unfathomable amount of cash into making your swanky week-long party for you and your rich buddies a reality, wouldn't you start telling cheeky freeloaders to go and scavange yummy popsicles off someone else?

Big is dutiful
So is Burning Man experiencing what happens to most people or things that get too big and too fashionable for their own good? Are we condemned to have any nice, well-meaning alternative society ravaged by the dirty dollar?
As always, the answer is “Yes, with an ‘if’”; or “no, with a ‘but.’”
It’s hard not to conclude that alternative economics are also based on another economic theory: one of scale. Twin Oaks seems to work because it’s not big enough to rattle the cage of Big Economics, instead nimble enough to scuttle round the edges, and nibble bits off it. But Burning Man is now so big that those famed founding principles seem to be scraping against an economic ceiling.
And the future? Well, Twin Oaks is still staffed by happy people selling tofu, and Burning Man has just bought a near-4000-acre piece of land next to Black Rock desert, where they may or may not be building a year-round Burning Man Intentional Community.
But unlike our cheery buddies in Twin Oaks, they will have hundreds of millions of dollars in cash flow, celebrity guests, and a scattering of Silicon Valley's richest supporters. One assumes that the Ten Principles will move into the new home with them.

Studies have shown that laughing causes your brain to release the same feel-good chemicals as, erm, opioids. It helps form deep emotional and social bonds with others, it's an outright antidepressant, and it leads to better relationships. People love being with people that make them laugh. Funny people are valued, because humour is complex. Laughter isn't only generated by jokes - we laugh at misfortune, slip-ups, slapstick, and suprise too. So an AI that could write killer gags that make us chuckle uncontrollably would have huge, measurable positive effects on the very fabric of society itself. Real human humour relies heavily on the context of the joke. Puns, mockery, dick-jokes, ridicule, sarcasm, witticism and satire all rely on "reading the room" perfectly at any given moment and delivering the joke with good timing. AI is... not so good at this.MONTAG'S COMEDY QUEEN REIGNS SUPREMEAs ever, it turned out that eternal MONTAG hero Janelle Shane - the research-scientist-turned-neural network-lovin'-funster - had got there first, and knocked it right out of the park. She fed a huge tranche of gags into a neural network and let the AI do its thing - which, as long-time readers will know, means it trots out a load of absurdities. The jokes she trained the AI on were of the simple, "What do you call a...?" kind - the sort that you introduce young children to to teach them what "funny" is. And just like a wannabe-standup toddler, the jokes the AI created with this limited understanding were more weird than funny:What do you call a cat does it take to screw in a light bulb?They could worry the banana.What did the new ants say after a dog?It was a pirate.Why did the monsters change a lightbulb?And a cow the cough.What do you call a pastor cross the road?He take the chicken.What do you call a farts of tea?He was calling the game of the dry.MONTAG is not afraid to admit that an inappropriate amount of laughter was generated by reading these zingers, particularly the last one, which is possibly the basis of a gross-out sketch from French Absurdist Jackass.However, the source of the chuckling was complicated: is a joke funny if it doesn't intend to be so? Janelle's AI-created gags were funny, alright: but at their core, we're actually laughing at the enjoyably bizarre results of the AI failing to understand what a joke is and how they work. VOICEBOXVoicebox describes itself as  "a creative keyboard for remixing language. It offers word suggestions based on custom source material, similar to your phone's predictive text." Intruiged, MONTAG selected the "Jerry Seinfeld Standup" option and started typing. Maybe we just don't have the same legendary skill as The Great Jerry to select the right funny words andf arrange them into a sentence, but... well, would you want to watch a whole set of this material?"KRAMER: The bearers of homosexual people don't suddenly run into somebody waving suits from cars, you know, Jerry." While this bon mot could be (I guess??) a literally true observation in some very select circumstances, and maybe it's the kind of thing Kramer would say... but it's once again a mere absurdity, not a gag. And as anyone who has sat through a show by a Monty-Python-inspired amateur comedy troupe will know, bad absurdity makes for a tough laugh-free evening.In other, more competant, hands, it must be noted that Voicebox does indeed start to drift into the realms of subtle satire, such as these faux-Wired tech reviews:iPhone 8: The iPhone 8’s 2½-gallon bucket is a wonderful addition. It holds a lot of caramel.Microsoft Surface: The Surface is little more than a rebranded box, and it shows movies like a futuristic metal donut. Higher resolution rainstorm videos available from your pixel dealer.First of all, MONTAG would like to go one record and state that we'd  love a phone that is also a futuristic metal donut. Yes, the chuckles here are again of the absurdist variety, but they're pretty good ones. However, it's hard to tell if the nose-thumbing at tech magazines' propensity to overhype new gadets is  the influence of the human operator or Voicebox istelf.The creators of Voicebox, Botnik, collaborated with Youtube comedy channel CollegeHumor and co-wrote a sketch using the technology. Humour is an ephemeral beast, so maybe you'll laugh a bit more than we did - but there is, if nothing else, hope in this sketch: surely AI-scripted comedy will get exponentially funnier.LOL-BOTLOL-BOT was billed as the World's First AI Comedian that "can generate its own on-the-spot jokes and pick up on real-time human reactions". It failed on two counts. First, it was fake - an April Fool's meta-gag, with the robot being operated by real humans, hidden backstage. Secondly, and most unfortunately, it wasn't funny. Which means that the humans operating it were not funny, and thus the whole LOL-BOT operation actually contributed a net loss of humour to the universe. Well done, Team LOL-BOT. Blueberry Improv BotNobody wants Improv comedy. And yet, swarms of unfunny people flock to do it, for some reason. So why not actually make it interesting for the audience (presumably hostages, no-one would voluntarily go to an Improv event) and throw in some AI to keep the comedians on their toes?Kory Mathewson, a PhD student from the University of Alberta, performs Improv comedy with the AI Robot buddy he created, Blueberry. Blueberry's AI was fed comedy in the form of a punishingly big meal: 1,200 comedy movie scripts, and when Kory and his buddies perform, the robot comic interjects with kinda-sorta non-sequiters which changes the path of the skit.It's tempting to consider Blueberry as an AI stooge, secretly heckling average comedians from within the scene itself in the guise of a 'helpful' comedy companion. A collaborating partner of Kory's described performing with the robot, "like having a “completely drunk comedian” on stage, who was only “accidentally funny,” by saying things that were totally inappropriate, overly emotional or plain odd."While having a real, extremely drunk person on stage might work better, Improv scenes featuring the robot have the added benefit of the flow being constantly interrupted, ensuring that any particularly unfunny moments don't last long.But in a wider sense, there is a scrap of hope in Blueberry the Un-Funny Robot. Whether you find Kory funny is subjective, but he's clearly smart and onto something important. Humans are instinctively squeamish when presented with a robot that doesn't recognise its subservience - so what better way for a robot butler to show deference to its human owner than a few gags at its own expense? Why did the chicken cross the road?Most of the "humour" that AI produces at the moment is accidentally funny. But maybe if AI can learn what gets a laugh, maybe it can develop the kind of self-deprecating humour that all of our robots and interfaces will need if we are to accept them into our homes. And it wouldn't hurt if Robo-Jeeves could crack a joke to lighten the mood.Until then, we hope Janelle Shane - who knows her way around a gag and how to coax machines into saying genuinely funny things - starts collaborating with Alexa, so we can fill the quiet moments at home with brand new jokes which spin old classics to interstellar-levels of weirdness:Why did the chicken cross the road?To screw in a light bulb.What’s black and white and red all over?A confuse on the bull!

Listening to music is one of life’s purest pleasures: a stroll through the most boring neighbourhood is made fabulous with the right music in your headphones (still listening with wires? Why not rent a pair of Beats Studio Wireless?)
The fact that we take for granted music’s power to move and motivate our minds is perhaps its biggest strength - and a slew of new ideas are taking advantage of music’s power.
Soon, you may listen to music specifically tailored for you to enhance your mood, or you might be prescribed learning an instrument to stave off mental ageing (get started right now with some music making gear.)

Teenage Kicks
Those pesky Teens, eh? Always hanging around your porch, looking for Pokemon, Snapchatting their Starbucks cup, and generally causing a nuisance as they strive for the perfect selfie. Here’s One Simple Trick to get rid of them for good: take advantage of their superior hearing.
And because today’s Teens aren’t into drinking, drugs or sex any more their ears are not yet dulled by years of nightclubs, hangover-induced tinnitus, or screaming babies - presenting you with a tasty life-hack opportunity.



Humans can generally hear sounds that dally between 20 herz (very low sounds) to 20,000 Herz (very high sounds). Play the above video that spans the human sonic spectrum - at what point are you unable to hear the noise any more? And did a local Teen start pouting and flicking his hair grumpily as the noise got higher?
The Mosquito is a device that plays a very loud, very annoying very high-pitched sound: the trick is that only teenagers are likely to be able to hear it, be annoyed by it, and go and hang around someone else’s porch instead.
Frankly, while this is a smart wrangling of age-based physiological differences, it feels a bit cruel: loud high pitched noises are unpleasant and painful. And while the Mosquito uses a physical trick to cause The Teens to scamper - there’s actually an easier, cheaper, and more fun method that relies on physiological tricks too: play really uncool music at loud volumes instead.
Just another troublesome teen, yesterday, via GIPHY
The LA Times reports that, “the sound of classical music is apparently so repellent to teenagers that it sends them scurrying away,” and “chains such as McDonald's and 7-Eleven, not to mention countless shopping malls around the world, have relied on classical music to shoo away potentially troublesome kids.”
The hilarious image of Troublesome Kids hitching up their low-slung denim and fleeing frantically to a place where the sound of Trap music is playing instead aside, there’s some fascinating sociological and psychological effects at work here. It relies on this simple system: when you hear music you don’t like, the brain actually suppresses dopamine - the chemical that makes you feel high and happy.
Conversely, when you do hear the music you enjoy, your brain gets a hefty squirt of the good stuff. And it’s this incredibly simple and measurable dynamic of “music in; happiness out” that’s being hijacked for good use.

Music Sounds Better With You



You’re more familiar with the effects of noise on the brain than you might think.
Your emotions have been manipulated with sounds for years: the thumping heartbeat is a staple in low-budget horror movies when a director wants to ramp up viewers’ fear (and then throw in a lame jump-scare in lieu of something actually horrifying.)
You've very possibly hijacked your own brain - or that or a baby (you monster!) Desperate parents have used white noise for years to short-circuit a screaming baby's brain and lull them to sleep. White noise, whether hissing from a de-tuned radio or a simple app, seems to induce a calm, sleepy state.
One psychologist who used white noise to provide a subtle and privacy-inducing wall of noise in his waiting room realised that he sometimes emerged to find his next appointment asleep, which I suppose raises the valid question of whether a client would find an unexpected daytime nap better value for money than an hour of talking therapy.
WHITE NOISE BONUS FACT: as well as “white” noise, there is also Pink noise, Red noise, and the intriguingly-named Brown noise. Disappointingly, Brown noise has absolutely nothing to do with the fabled “Brown note” made famous in an episode of South Park, where our intrepid heroes discover a noise so deep and loud it induces immediate diarrhoea.
via GIPHY
If all noise had a knock-on effect as noticeable as spontaneous bowel evacuation, maybe we’d have more mindful appreciation of its existence, albeit with a dramatically heightened dry-cleaning bill. Yet because noise is just there, all the time, we tend not to think about the effect it has.
Noise is all-pervasive, but as anyone who lives near a local airport will know, we’re really good at tuning it out, even very loud, repetitive, 747-sized noise.
But too much noise also has huge, measurable negative effects on your health. Oh wait, and too-little noise too. It turns out that noise has a wide range of effects that are only just being full understood.
Studies at Berkeley University have found that too much noise - like a nearby wind turbine or a yapping dog - can have horrible negative effects on sleep, mental health and even your ability to learn. Meanwhile, if you put some people in a room designed to create absolute silence, they start to freak out due to the lack of noise.



Far from being something that’s just fun or annoying, music, sound and noise has a very subtle - and very deep - impact.

Music has an incredibly strong emotional pull: when a piece of music moves us, “there is little — in those moments of listening, at least — that we value more.”
So, if the brain can be gamed with a carefully-curated playlist, what are people trying to do with this newly-found skill?
One company, called Sync Music, seem to be running in 20 different directions at once as it uncovers new ways that music can make life measurably better.
Music might, they found, improve your memory or could help re-kindle the brain activity of people with severe head trauma, or simply help with your stress management.
They’ve also collaborated with Marconi Union to create bespoke music in tune with your heartbeat that is designed to calm you down, and induce peace.
And Soylent-slurpin’, growth-hackin’, full-stackin’ Silicon Valley types can add another Powerful Life Hack to their list, because Sync Music has a way to make you #worksmarter, too.
They’ve made a bot for wildly popular workplace chat service Slack which creates smart playlists designed to help you concentrate when all about you are losing their heads (or at least having an utterly tiresome Nerf Gun battle), or give you energy to plough through the post-holiday bottomless pit of emails.

It seems that music may not only hath charms to soothe the savage beast, but also bring real, tangible relief to those in pain.
Anticipation of the emotional peaks during music triggers Dopamine release - this is what is responsible for the shivers of pleasure you feel when the Beatles hit their head-waggling, “ah-ahhh-ahhhhhhh-AHHHHHHHH” stride. But it’s possibly also useful for people with depression who need repeated mood lifts, or those who have diseases that result in low dopamine levels, like Parkinson’s.
It’s not a wonder-cure, but if listening to a playlist of especially-selected songs that are proven to boost dopamine alleviated even a small percentage of suffering, how can it be a bad thing?

Of course, this research was spun with inevitable hyperbole into “10 Songs That Will Get You High, According to Science”: but only you can be the judge of whether the above playlist, which features erm, Infected Mushroom and Tiesto, makes you feel violently happy or merely violent.
Meanwhile, other research has possibly found the reason that famously M.O.R. saxophonist Kenny G is so endlessly happy: playing an instrument and making music is, apparently, the equivalent of “a full-body workout for the brain.”

So, much like the recent realisation that MDMA may not just help you dance all night and tell your friends that, no-no-no-I-really-really-LOVE-you-mate, but also help loosen the mental chains around traumatic events; music may be able to help with the healing of this trauma.
Hmm, music that induces euphoria coupled with MDMA… maybe all those old ravers were onto something all along.

The Sound of Music
If the idea that “music makes you feel better” make you ¯\(ツ)/¯ IRL at the and-are-you-going-to-tell-me-the-Pope-is-a-Catholic-ness of it all, please curb your cynicism.
Yes, of course: it’s not surprise that music can make you feel things. But we now have the tech and the personal data to make it really useful.
By mixing up the bio-feedback from your Apple Watch with your sleep patterns from your Fitbit and blending them with the glut of data that your music streaming platform has on you, you could find your life is not just soundtracked to make everything nicer, but more happy, calm, and forgiving.
And because it’ll be medicine, maybe you can charge your Spotify subscription to your health insurance too. Now that’s a future I can live in.

The weird thing about happiness is that people don't always like to read about it, think about it, or do things that are proven to bring it.So today, MONTAG is setting out a bold agenda which promises to revolutionise your life. We have a simple set of step-by-step instructions that, in decreasing order of scientific trustworthiness, will bring you the happiness that you deserve. Each step will increase your happiness, and none will detract from it. Here are those steps, in full:Stop wasting your time trying to achieve so muchSlack off at work and/or work much lessFind a really, really, really niche interest and follow it down the rabbit hole.You may feel an instinctive snort of ridicule tickling the back of your nose. Choke it down and read on. Happiness awaits 👉One: Stop wasting your time trying to achieve so muchThe recent American Time Use Survey - which revealed that those earning over $100K are no happier than those with incomes of $25K. Surprise! The “success” that came with an increased salary did not increase the recipients’ happiness.The Legatum Institute - an “independent non-partisan public policy organisation” is founded “upon the principle that prosperity is a more capacious idea than can be expressed by a purely material measure such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP).” They published a hefty research and policy document on Wellbeing, in which, they discovered something fascinating. It was this: while CEOs were best-paid, they were no happier than their secretaries. It turns out that the act of striving to succeed is Happiness Kryptonite: trying to make lots of success or money happen does not make you happier.via GIPHYPaul Dolan, professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics, also studied the American Time Use Survey and observed that the happiest and most fulfilled people work between 21 and 30 hours per week. He also noted that, from the 31 hour-per-week mark upwards, misery increases hand-in-hand with each extra hour. There are 9000 financial workers in financial hubs like London and Hong Kong who work over 100 hours per week: how happy can they possibly be? What are they feeling as a reward for working those 69 extra hours per week? What has dragged them out of the happiness sweetspot and plonked them back at their desk? Could it be... something other than happiness? But what is there?Two: Slack off at work and/or work much lessIf you have experienced that dull feeling that work in 2019 is filled with bullshit tasks that are utterly pointless, and that really we should only be working four days a week nowadays, you’d be absolutely correct. André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City, University of London, says that “coasting at work is the best thing for your career, health and happiness.” In other words, pushing yourself as hard as possible at work has the opposite effect to your aim: you become less happy, less successful and, as a final kicker, you get ill, too. Larks!(If you’re still not sure about this one, try asking people around the water cooler if making three-day weekends normal would make them any happier.)via GIPHYResearch at the University of British Columbia showed that society is split into two fairly even halves: people who value time more than money, and people who value money over time, and their preference leaked into all of their decision making in life. But the people who valued extra free time to do what they wanted over having extra money were happier, because - and you’ll have to temper your expectations of any staggering breakthroughs here - in that extra time, these people did things that they enjoyed doing, like, well anything. Watching TV, gardening, doing spurious hobbies: all these are better at bringing happiness than - again, bear with me here - doing more work. And to access secret bonus levels of happiness, all you have to do is make the activities in that time meaningful. Project lead researcher Ashley Whillans said, “Even giving up a few hours of a paycheck to volunteer at a food bank may have more bang for your buck in making you feel happier.”Three: Find a really, really, really niche interest and follow it right down the rabbit hole.You don’t have to righteously donate your time to good causes to reap the benefits: if you’ve overworked for years, it’s *you* who is the charity case, stupid. So treat yourself to some indulgent, focussed, me-time. And the more niche, the better it is for - well, maybe not your happiness, but your overall wellbeing.Carol A. Bernstein, associate professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine, says that there’s a fine line between a beneficial hobby that serves as a distraction from work, and a damaging obsession that compulsively eats up your time. But finding a hobby that really, truly scratches your personal itch and that provides a space to get lost in is overwhelmingly good for your soul.So what to pick? MONTAG dug deep and found some examples of people who are truly Living Their Best Life through utterly, utterly niche hobbies. Why not see if one will suit you?Extreme Washing Machine InterestIt’s safe to say that the nameless owner of the Washercrazy Youtube channel loves washing machines and washing machine accessories. Whether he’s reviewing washing machines in his local store, filming and commentating on entire wash cycles at a series of laundrettes, or posting unboxing videos of spin-dryers bought for him as a gift by his mum, his interest is true and pure and has staggering depth: he’s uploaded over 1000 videos of washing machines so far.Our nameless washing machine hero is - in all seriousness - setting an example to us all, freeing himself from the restraints of embarrassment and openly embracing his enjoyment with unfettered glee. Just watch the palpable excitement in “At the laundrette part 2”, where he reacts with deep satisfaction as the ageing machine segues into a spin cycle that nearly rattles his bottle of fabric softener into a new dimension - and tell me that you don’t envy the waves of happiness that are washing over him.What is the root of this very niche hobby? It’s not clear - but who cares? Here’s a man who lives and breathes washing machines and takes deep enjoyment from every aspect of it. MONTAG wishes him, and his new machine, a Samsung EcoBubble WF5E2-W4WEU, many years of happiness from his hobby.The Comprehensive Plastic Chair HobbyistBryan Ropar's Plastic Chair World is a Youtube channel of devastating simplicity: it’s a channel where a man called Bryan documents the topic that he finds most interesting: plastic chairs.Watch him count down the top 100 plastic chairs in his collection and *feel* the calm, the deep satisfaction and the confidence he exudes as Bryan simply lists the various chairs in the order he feels best expresses his preference. And while MONTAG feels that #55 - the ProGarden S-I-T chair - should have ranked much higher, who are we to argue? Bryan has found his niche, and is a clear expert: he’s owned between 600-800 plastic chairs in his life, cares about their history and design and has uploaded over 100 videos about plastic chairs, including one slightly mournful one entitled, “Watching The Chair Get Thrown Away.” Once more, Bryan’s hobby needs no explanation, and neither should yours. Feel no fear if your true fascination lies in injection-moulded furniture, for your happiness lies within easy reach, and it’s stackable for easy storage in your garage.真ん中小五郎 - Documenting Skateboarding PugsGonta the Pug likes riding skateboards whilst dressed in natty clothing. And Gonta’s owner likes videoing this and uploading it to Youtube, hundreds of times. Here’s Gonta in a colourful onesie. Here’s Gonta wearing light-up Hallowe’en pumpkins.  Here’s Gonta wearing a hat with leaves sticking out of it. What does each additional video say? What does it bring to the conversation? These questions are starting from the wrong point: what does each additional video *not* bring to the life of Gonta’s owner? Gonta, her vast wardrobe and her ability to ride a skateboard are all that is needed for her owner to find happiness: your thoughts are, correctly, meaningless.Knob FeelA channel of hundreds of videos where the uploader indulges his innate ability to communicate his analysis of the haptic sensation of various tech device knobs without the use of words contains so many lessons for us all on the topic of Following Your Passion To Its Logical Conclusion that we don’t know how to put it into words.The French Elevator ChannelOK, by now, you know the drill: this is a channel filled with hundreds of videos of elevators. And it’s French, so it’s sophisticated and a tiny bit snobbish.Before you roll your eyes and assume that this channel is some sort of post-ironic meme, cast an eye over the data that accompanies his review of a “RARE Schindler Smart 002 MRL elevator” found in the small town of Vienne:This is very rare in France !

Don’t strive so hard you make yourself ill, and work fewer hours so that you have more time to enjoy life. And that enjoyment, ideally, will come spending free time in a nourishing, indulgent passion.IMPORTANT NOTE: When you reach that sweetest of sweet spots in the niche-est of niches, the world will not begin to understand why what you’re doing makes you so happy. And that’s the point: if your hobby doesn’t even slightly expose you to the chance of ridicule, are you really doing the thing that’s truly *you*? If you’re not already doing something weird in an attempt to make yourself happy, what are you even working *for*?

The world of work is more uncertain and blurrier than it has ever been before. A “job for life” - common to the parents of Gen X and Millennials - now either sounds like an impossible absurdity, like spotting a Dodo on your way to the pub, or worse, a threat.
Meanwhile, we’re all making the best we can of what’s left of the workplace, and technology has allowed whole new genres of work to thrive. While you and I may be weighing up the consequences of becoming a food delivery cyclist (in the “pro” column: super shredded thighs, bro), others have discovered that being a Youtube Content Creator is not just a legitimate way to make cash, with a chillingly ad-agency-tuned job title, but it will make them lots of the green stuff. It’ll bring fame, wealth and controversy along for the ride too.
In the world of the Online Celeb, being a douchebag is optional - but apparently it helps. And nothing enhances your douchebag status than extreme wealth, plus - as demonstrated by The Rich Kids Of Instagram - there is the added advantage that your wealthy status actually creates more money, and so on.
Say what you like about either of these groups of people, but by accident or design, they have found a way to make money by just having fun: playing video games, going shopping, reacting to things and then uploading a video of it with an accompanying “Youtube Face".
via GIPHY
Essentially, they make money by doing what they’d do when not doing what the other 99% traditionally consider “work”. Their “play” has become their “work”. Of course it works a bit differently for us. Here's how your work will become your play. Maybe you won't be able to tell the difference, or care. Time to jump into the verisimulator.
What do people do if given endless free time with no financial constraints?
Sadly, you and I are probably not going to become wealthy by filming our day-to-day lives, unless you are the sort of person whose first reaction to stumbling across a dead body is to apologise to your fans for the video not being as “fun” as you intended. However, we do need to contend with the same murky re-balancing of work and play, because, as discussed ad nauseam on MONTAG previously, the machines are coming for your job.
Yet if you’re holding out for the dream of Universal Basic Income - the juicy state hand-out for everyone - well, you might actually be backing the right horse: test studies in Finland show that giving people UBI seems to deliver a net positive for society.
And yet. What are you gonna do with your time? What happens when you can choose exactly what to do with your life? What fills the gap?
X Marx the spot
Marx’s "Fragment on Machines”, as Kathryn explained recently, posits that  “since capitalism relies on the surplus of labor and accelerates technology to accomplish this labor, it will eventually create the conditions of its own undoing: labor time will be reduced to almost nothing, and workers will be free to develop themselves as individuals.”
So… do people, without the pressure of needing to work to earn, choose a lifestyle of freedom, fun and games? Do they switch from Work to Play?
If the burgeoning genre of “verisimulation” games is anything to go by: no, not really.
Just Deserts
A “verisimulator” is a game that is “stupefyingly like reality.” It’s a game that replicates, in excruciating detail, a reasonably common and achievable job, like driving a train or a truck. And they're much more popular than you'd believe.
A verisimulator is distinct to a Sim game like Sim City or The Sims, in that in the latter you are playing god and building worlds, where as in a verisimulator, you perform tightly-defined tasks in a world that already very much exists. In both cases you like out a fantasy of doing something you don’t get to do in your day-to-day life; it’s just that in verisimulators, you could do them if you really wanted to.
Bluntly put, verisimulators are intensely boring. And that’s just how their millions of fans like it.
The grandparent of verisimulator games is a mini game buried in a 90’s Sega Megadrive game that was never actually released to the public. Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors would have been released on the Sega Mega-CD if the developer of the game hadn’t gone bust just before launch. Allegedly, the game has cameos by Debbie Harry and Lou Reed, which, unless you hung around the Lower East Side in 1978, means that generally, the game is not much like real life.
But - the CD contained a bunch of mini-games designed by titular anti-heroes Penn and Teller, one of which was Desert Bus: a game where you had to drive a bus, in a straight line, across a desert, for eight hours without a break.



The snag? The steering is not quite centred, so the role of the "driver" is to correct the steering so that the bus doesn’t slowly veer off the road and crash. If you allow this to happen, the bus is towed back to the start, and you begin again.
For successful players, after having driven 400 miles in real time, your prize is to earn one point, and the opportunity to drive back to the start again. In real time. To win one more point.
The game gets really tricky on the way back, when the sun sets and the bus’s paltry lights cast a limited splash of light onto the road surface, making continuing in a straight line a little harder.
Occasionally, something exciting happens, like here when a bug splats against the screen.
Desert Bus is played strictly for the LOLs. For The Win. It’s couched in irony. It's a game with rolled-up jeans, art-brut tattoos, a waxed moustache and one of those little wool hats perched on the back of its head. No-one plays Desert Bus expecting it to be like driving a bus.
For that, you need one of the many modern bus-driving verisimulators, a desire to drive a bus without leaving your home, and a lot of patience.
Bus-A-Move
Of those games which recreate in agonising detail the devastating mundanity of real-life bus-driving work, OMSI: The Bus Simulator reigns supreme. OMSI allows you to pick a route, and… drive a bus. You collect passengers every kilometre or so, taking their money, giving them the correct change, and pulling off into traffic again. It captures every single tiny detail of an utterly normal day of an utterly normal job, and lets you “play” (or should that be "work"?) it in real time.



Fans are breathless about the game’s accuracy: “You get to drive a very accurate, detailed, digital version of a real German omnibus. Nearly all the dashboard controls and buttons are fully operational. The engine noises are spectacularly-well done. They even captured the rickety windows and loose parts of the bus shaking and vibrating when going over bumps, which sounds extremely realistic.”
It’s easy to sneer at OMSI, but driving a bus is no more facile, boring or stupid than running around with a gun in Gears of War, and shooting virtual people in the head is no more pointless than dropping them off at bus stops and bidding them cheerio.
The market for these games is only limited by players’ desire to virtually experience severely ordinary work, although the games do lean quite a lot towards transportation-based roles.
Here’s the mighty Euro Truck Simulator 2, in which you can experience the thrills, spills and - one supposes, the gut-wrenching excitement - of driving a bus full of passengers to, for instance, Gdansk in a Marcopolo Paradiso G7 1800 DD.
In ETS2, you can enjoy every tiny gear change, squeak of the suspension and every tick-tock of the indicator as you trundle towards Gdansk. I note that the bus has clearly been maintained in a cosy and warm condition, judging by the number of female passengers who have chosen to wear tight jeans and crop-tops.



And if steering seems like too much of a drag, what about Train Simulator 2017? Who, honestly, has not wanted to drive a French TGV the 105km that lies between Marseille and Avignon?



And... if the idea of movement itself is boring, what about Car Mechanic Simulator 2018, where you can repair cars as a virtual mechanic in a perfectly and lovingly created car garage?



“At last you have the chance to experience your dream job - driving a truck”
To the outside world, the enjoyment of the verisimulator is almost impossible to understand. Often this bewilderment is expressed as bemusement, or downright amusement. In this “Let’s Play” video, two Polygon writers, one of whom sounds like Mike Diamond from the Beastie Boys, but probably isn’t, play American Truck Simulator, and - understandably - are unable to resist the temptation of playing it absurdly.
Their chaotic gameplay makes the game look like a version of Grand Theft Auto where you can only drive trucks, and where murder sprees are the result of disastrously ill-judged driving decisions.



Once writers Griffin and Justin get going, a weirdly hypnotic sense to the gameplay sets in. The sparse landscape zips past as they career down freeways and it’s not dissimilar to the weird soporific state you achieve after several hours of driving along an Autobahn without taking a break.
However, their guffaw-laden gameplay is not that of a typical American Truck Simulator gamer, and neither is their habit of crashing their truck into gas stations. Indeed, the forums for ATS are awash with gamers dissecting the game’s nuances.
Once again, discussions centre on the game’s realistic nature, and gamer MatzTruckz is impressed:
“The (gear) ratios and transmission/drivetrain physics are definitely close enough for manual 18-speed shifting. I just finished a few thousand miles today and really enjoyed it.”
Here’s where the gap that feels insurmountable to most appears. One avid gamer humblebragged about the hours he’d spent playing American Truck Simulator, claiming in excess of 300 hours of play behind the wheel. That’s the equivalent to about two months’ worth of real-life employment.
It doesn’t take a highly inquisitive mind to ask one simple question: why not just... become a bus driver? According to Stagecoach, one of the UK’s main bus operators, training to become a driver takes just a few days. Our friend who clocked in hundreds of hours could have earned a month’s wages of real money, in the real world, in that time.
So why is he and the many, many other verisimulator gamers doing it?
Making the dream virtual reality
People generally work for the fulfilment of a task well done, the feeling of being part of a team or community, and the sense that they are vaguely adding something to society. Perhaps verisimulators give gamers that feeling, albeit in a field that ticks a childhood ambition, that is not too distant to be utterly unimaginable.
Being repeatedly shot in a war game might be thrilling, but it's too extraordinary to feel real. But if you find driving a truck exciting, then a verisimulator offers an experience that is close enough to feel real, and just far enough away to feel viscerally thrilling.
Whatever the reason is, verisimulators certainly hint at a future that we’re all soon to inhabit: a future where our jobs either vanish or are suddenly not needed, or are deemed uncool. You’ll want to do something with your time, and if money is no longer an issue, why not pander to your true self and do what you really want?
Maybe driving a train, or a truck isn’t your fantasy, but be honest: is that really any kinkier than the life you truly yearn for?



pic.twitter.com/4Q4xchlE3m— popular comedy account “the pixelated boat” (@pixelatedboat) March 12, 2018


I set out to write about this movie the way that I thought it should be approached: with full nerd-immersion.
Re-reading the book to brush up on all the references, character nuances, and plot points before going to see the movie, I was surprised to find myself enjoying the book much in the way that one enjoys a big-budget action film.
I remembered it as a disappointing mashup of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Snow Crash, a comparison that isn't unique – in an interview with SyFy, Ernest Cline directly says the Roald Dahl book was an inspiration.
And while I wasn't disturbed upon first or second reading by the constant litany of pop culture references (most of which, I must admit, I was only familiar with through cultural osmosis, not lived experience, having been born smack in the middle of the Millennials), I thought it a shame that while it pulled inspiration and source material from practically every science fiction and fantasy canon, the world constructed by the book itself failed to meet the same standards of the imaginative, speculative, pointed and politically allegorical universes from which it takes inspiration.
If you aren't familiar with the book or film, it's about a virtual world called the OASIS, created by James Halliday, a video game prodigy turned reclusive billionaire. When he dies, he launches a contest to give his vast fortune and control of the simulation to whoever can find the "Easter Egg" he's hidden in the massive game.
There are riddles, keys, and gates to be found along the way, but the trials to decode the riddles, find these keys, and clear the gates are based entirely on an obsessive knowledge about video games, movies, music, and pop culture from Halliday's youth in the late 1970s and early 1980s: which explains why an 18-year-old born in 2027 cares at all about these dated references.
Although the protagonists and narrative are suited for today's teens, the target audience for the book is clearly those who would be closer to Halliday's age (and of course it's not unheard-of, given the success of franchises like Twilight and The Hunger Games, for Generation X and even Baby Boomers to enjoy dystopian YA books).
The circumstances and challenges presented for a kid (our hero protagonist, Wade Watts) living in abject poverty IRL, trying to win at life in a world-wide immersive VR simulation and defend it from a soul-crushing corporate entity, is much less impressive being published in 2011, than when the original Metaverse was conceived in 1992, and the conditions of the world that drives people to immerse themselves in a video game for most of their lives and social interactions (a global energy crisis, widespread economic, political, and environmental instability) are sketched as a fairly generic dystopia, which is escaped simply by being freakishly well-versed in popular culture of the 80s.
This is where the backlash against the book usually comes in: its central conceit, that liking, identifying with, and storing vast amounts of information about certain media makes you better, more authentic, more intelligent (and in this case, more worthy of inheriting responsibility for the fate of the world) than your peers, is grating. It carries with it the air of smugness and superiority, not to mention the gatekeeping and exclusivity, demonstrated by groups like Gamergate and other "causes" whose champions weaponize their perceived victimization due to their niche interests, and render them insufferable.
But I want to be clear: most people in the year of our lord 2018 don't actually have a problem with the universes created by Neal Stephenson, William Gibson, Philip K. Dick, George Lucas, Joss Whedon, and all the other white male gods of the nerdiverse (one reference I forgot until re-reading was that both Cory Doctorow and Wil Wheaton are name-dropped as being still alive in 2045, and are elected co-mayors of the OASIS), their problem is with the anger and entitlement that comes out of these fan groups' perceptions of their own victimization and the toxic nerd culture that produces. The Daily Dot's Gavier Baker-Whitelaw explains and summarizes the pre-hate for the film that circulated in jokes about its target audience on Twitter well in her article "Why the internet is so ready to hate ‘Ready Player One’". It's also distilled well in this "rejected theme song" by Demi Adejuyigbe:



To further clarify both the discourse around toxic nerd culture and how engaging with certain types of media considered nerdy is perceived socially today, when Michael B. Jordan, a star of Marvel's Black Panther, which recently surpassed the box office record of Titanic this summer, revealed that he's a fan of anime like Dragonball Z and Naruto, the nerdiverse and larger cultural sphere went wild with approval.

After seeing Steven Spielberg's adaption of Ready Player One, I wasn't disappointed *in* the nerds who love this book, but *for* them. 

These days, there's very little social stigma against people who play video games, watch anime, and identify with their love of comic books or franchises like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, because these once-niche interests have gone entirely mainstream thanks to the proliferation of media on the internet and the mass market capitalization on these cultural products. The stigma lies only in the holier-than-thou attitude that some people who identify with these cultural products project on the so-called "normies."
But after seeing Steven Spielberg's adaption of Ready Player One, I wasn't disappointed in the nerds who love this book, but for them.

READY PLAYER ONE (2018)Dir: Steven Spielberg pic.twitter.com/CZ3qQYTOyj— Stuart Wellington (@flophousecat) March 6, 2018


First, I have to acknowledge the reality of copyright. I know that it's simply unfeasible for a Hollywood movie to actually put every musical, cinematic, and video game reference that was jammed into the book into the movie, if only because of the limitations of licensing. Apparently Spielberg spent three years with a licensing team trying to secure rights to use Star Wars characters and the Japanese giant robot Ultraman.
But after reading the book and seeing the movie back to back, I found myself in a fit of entitled, insufferable nerdrage at its deviations.
I wanted to scream "REEEEEE!!! THIS ISN'T CANON!" mere minutes into the film, when Wade logs in to the OASIS for the first time and fails to see the words "Ready Player One" appear on the load-in.
Other reviews have called Ready Player One "an interactive museum of late-20th- and early-21st-century entertainment, a maze of niche tastes, cultish preoccupations and blockbuster callbacks", "wallowing in ‘80s nostalgia", and its "weaponized nostalgia" an "exercise in overkill"... but I truly wonder if me and these reviewers saw the same movie.
Ready Player One's film adaptation strips out almost all of the lore related to the early days of video games beyond the Atari 2600: there's scarcely a reference to Dungeons and Dragons, Zork, or a single MUD. There is not a moment on screen where the protagonists play cabinet arcade games (something they do for approximately 25% of the book). Key cultural touchstones that feature heavily in the book's plot like the game Joust and Rush's album 2112 are cut out of the narrative in favor of higher-acton sequences like car races and zombie fights, and appear only as posters and t-shirts. And while some viewers might be delighted by these easter egg-like references to the book, I found them annoyingly sparse and superficial.

i for one think the Ready Player One posters are fantastic because they tell you exactly what you’re getting—the replacement of substance with reference with no real thought past that pic.twitter.com/Qp3DwHvvq0— 🇮‌🇹‌🇸‌🇿‌🇺 (@Itszutak) March 6, 2018


Don't get me wrong, there are many, many pop culture references, but the most obvious ones have been updated to appeal to Millennials and Generation Z: a Minecraft world, the Overwatch character Tracer appearing in multiple scenes, and a swarm of HALO grunts. And many of the cinematic references, like the presence of King Kong, a T-Rex from Jurassic Park, and the extended sequence of their immersion in a virtual version of The Shining's Overlook Hotel, seem to be poised to appeal more to Spielberg's fanboys than Cline's.
There were so many tiny moments that I expected the minutiae of the book to shine through: I was watching the film with the same dissecting and critical eye that the book's characters use to log and categorize the minutiae of the 80s.
Why would they change the year printed on the quarters over Halliday's eyes in his funeral scene to read "1972," when in the prologue of the book there's a footnote devoted to the fact they say "1984"? Why (well, for obvious reasons, but still) would they change Parzival's license plate to read "PARZIVAL" instead of "ECTO-88" – and why does he have his tricked-out DeLorean with KITT on it to start with, when he's supposed to be a totally broke kid who's still in high school?
What happened to the high school? One of the major redeeming factors of the OASIS was that it was a gigantic public school system and a repository of knowledge that was free for all, despite the crumbling infrastructure of actual cities: a utopian vision of free access to information that today's internet pioneers are still striving for.
It also nullifies and inverts the central conflict of the book: the big bad guys, corporate overlords IOI, don't only want to sell advertising space in OASIS, they want to apply content filters and charge a monthly subscription free, limiting access to the escapism and freedom of expression that millions have found in an open source platform for education, work, and all the fun stuff, that allows one to improve their lot in real life through an avatar unencumbered by their race, gender, and social class.
The book also acknowledges that this escape can be a prison, and the real-life potential consequences of spending all of your time logged in, which leads to several of the characters becoming complete recluses. In the middle of the book, when Wade has successfully used his OASIS celebrity from finding the first key to secure enough virtual product-endorsement money to rent an apartment in the real world away from his abusive and drug-addicted extended family, he is cooped up in a one-room efficiency apartment with the windows blacked out, completely isolated and loathing of his physical existence. Two of his friends, Daito and Shoto, are revealed to be hikikomori in Japan, who although they are brothers in the OASIS, have never met in real life. And the warnings that his love interest Art3mis and best friend Aech give him, that no one is anything like their real identity in the OASIS, are later proven true by the revelations that Art3mis has a birthmark that she considers disfiguring, and that Aech, who is a semi-famous white, male gladiator competing in televised battles in the OASIS, is in reality a homeless, gay, black woman.
Aech's identity in particular is a high point for the book as an example of how anonymity and the construction of an alternative online identity can be socially beneficial. When she finally meets Wade, she explains that her mother taught her to always present as white and male in the OASIS for preferential treatment, after apologizing for deceiving him with her gender presentation throughout their friendship. After revealing her sexuality to her family, she was kicked out of the house and forced to live in her RV, but is able to sustain herself online and on the street due to her online fame. In the film, changing her character into an orc-like cyborg is a classic example of lazy fantasy racism that erases this illustration of the potentially liberatory power of technology to supercede social bias.
And instead of preserving the OASIS as a place of knowledge and freedom, where players can escape regardless of how bleak their reality is, the final sequence of the film reveals that after Wade and his friends take over control of the OASIS, they close it two days a week. It's a maddeningly antithetical appeal to normalcy.

Ready Player One is a fun reminder that everything I've ever loved is garbage and I'm garbage and the world would be better if people like me didn't exist— Mike Drucker (@MikeDrucker) March 6, 2018


These gripes, along with those catalogued by others including the literal weaponization of the peace-loving Iron Giant left me angry. Even in a book where fat, ugly social outcasts can star in a rags-to-riches story, none of them are allowed in Hollywood to be even slightly overweight or have a spot of acne.
In the spirit of the book, every reference that was legally possible for them to include should have been spot on. How could a fanbase that loves the idea of combing frame by frame through vintage games and movies, memorizing every line of dialogue, and knowing endless amounts of trivia about the media of their choice be satisfied with less?
What was a celebration of escapism, that technology can bring people together and set them free in ways that reality can't, becomes a screed against geek culture, a watered-down and hyper-monetized, ad-riddled (don't think we didn't notice the Pizza Hut drone and Doritos in Lena Waithe's van) Avatar-looking-ass mess, and an insult to fans and fanatics who did their homework. Steven Spielberg, why didn't you do yours?


Miku Hatsune isn’t like other Japanese pop stars.
According to Crypton Future Media, she is 5 feet 2 inches tall, weighs 93 pounds, and has been 16 years old since 2007.
Miku is “an android diva in the near-future world where songs are lost,” with a recommended vocal range between countertenor and mezzo-soprano, but which is theoretically infinite. She is the personification of a VOCALOID, a synthetic voice software developed by Yamaha Corporation. Crypton Future Media licensed this technology, meant for professional audio producers, and created a series of characters to go with the electronic voices. Hatsune Miku, also known as CV01 or Character Voice 01, was included in the Vocaloid2 series and sold 40,000 copies within a year.


Hatsune Miku Vocaloid2 software via Wikipedia

The Vocaloids are designed to be used to create original music, and Miku has now performed in over 100,000 professionally produced songs and literally millions of fan works. In 2016, she performed with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, and gave concerts in China, Costa Rica, Germany, the United States, Canada, and Mexico. As long as she has her distinctive synthesized voice, black and turquoise school uniform, and almost floor-length twin blue pigtails, it doesn’t matter which media format she’s represented in: from pure audio to holograms that perform live and in virtual reality, it’s all Hatsune Miku.

She’s made appearances in anime series, video games, commercials, and other media, but her hologram concerts are probably what Hatsune Miku is best known for now.

She’s made appearances in anime series, video games, commercials, and other media, but her hologram concerts are probably what Hatsune Miku is best known for now. Thousands of people pay for tickets to pack into a stadium and wave glow sticks to her music as she is projected on stage as a hologram.



A reporter for Polygon went to one of her shows on the 2016 North America tour and reported that her hologram appeared between eight and eleven feet tall, that she didn’t stop singing and dancing for three hours and changed costumes instantaneously, but other than that it was much like a concert by any human pop star.
You can also attend a Hatsune Miku concert in virtual reality by purchasing PlayStation VR’s Hatsune Miku VR Future Live. In this version, the concert is also a game, where you can choose songs and score up points to get to the special encore. The VR concerts promise special effects that are impossible in real life, and allow you to see her show from any angle in the virtual arena. Miku fans are used to seeing her projected, so she fits perfectly on a virtual stage, and the live concert experience, glowsticks and all, is replicated with surprising accuracy. According to a reporter from The Verge who tried the concert experience at home, “I got swept up in the crowd — even though that crowd was completely virtual.”

“Real,” (that is, corporeal) artists are rushing to roll out their own virtual reality concerts as well.

“Real,” (that is, corporeal) artists are rushing to roll out their own virtual reality concerts as well. For some acts, that simply involves placing a 360º camera in the front row of a concert or on a drone and allowing people to tune into a live or recorded performance to virtually attend.
For others, like Swedish megastars ABBA, the concert is a small piece of a larger VR entertainment experience. After not performing together for 30 years, the group is working with music business mogul Simon Fuller for a virtual reunion tour. Fuller describes it as “a groundbreaking venture that will utilize the very latest in digital and virtual-reality technology… which will enable a new generation of fans to see, hear and feel Abba in a way previously unimagined.”
This sounds like it will not be simply a performance, but an interactive experience with a completely digitized version of the band. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the members of ABBA performing as or with younger versions of themselves.
Björk has also teamed up with virtual reality artists to create 360º music videos and virtual reality experiences for the songs on her most recent album, Vulnicura, that are being shown at London’s Somerset House as part of the exhibition Björk Digital. For the opening of the exhibition, she appeared as a motion-capture virtual reality avatar with iridescent, golden skin and otherworldly costuming, and in many of her videos she regularly breaks the laws of physics.



ABBA and Björk’s digital representations attest to their ability to transcend the limits of space and time through virtual performances, and digitized performers have even blurred the boundary between life and death, as evidenced by Tupac’s 2012 performance at Coachella, despite being murdered in 1996.
The Tupac performance in particular raised a lot of public speculation about whether it was ethical to resurrect deceased performers as holograms or digital representations. Given the recent deaths of such colossal stars as Prince and David Bowie, who both presumably have a wealth of unreleased material, this issue is back on the table and not a question of “can” but “should?” Would we want to see these recently departed stars perform previously unheard music? Or would it be disrespectful to their families and their fans to continue their musical legacy posthumously? A reporter for MTV news speculated that it may become a common occurrence for pop stars to specify explicitly whether they would or would not like to continue giving performances after their death.

The question now is: will we create more virtual pop stars?

Given how convincing and enjoyable the Hatsune Miku virtual reality concert experience is, we know that the technology to create virtual reality stadium shows from scratch has reached the point of feasibility. The question now is will we create more virtual pop stars? Miku’s success came unexpectedly, and as improbable as it seems, her now-iconic image was not, at the time, designed for the mass otaku appeal she now enjoys.
There has already been another living (so to speak) example of a computer-engineered, realistic looking pop star. Eguchi Aimi, who joined the Japanese girl group AKB48 in 2011, was actually a composite of the “best features” of six of the other girls in the group, created to advertise Glico candy. AKB48 fans were instantly suspicious of this new member, and after fan backlash, the candy company were the ones who broke the news that she was never a real girl. In 2013, she was removed from the group’s website.



The parallels between Eguchi Aimi and Hatsune Miku outline what could be the future of entertainment. As demonstrated by ABBA, Björk, and Tupac, pop stars can already perform as digital representations of themselves, and Hatsune Miku and ABBA’s virtual reality concert experiences promise a level of intimacy with the virtual stars that consumers are already clamoring for. The only piece missing is exemplified by Aimi: engineering a virtual pop star who is convincing, who can earn the trust of their audience, and give a flawless performance every time.
The virtual reality concert experience is here, and the only thing it’s missing is more virtual stars.

In our explorations of alternative financial systems so far for MONTAG's Modern Money issue, you may have noticed a soupçon of anti-capitalist sentiment, a light dusting of skepticism towards the current global financial system, or a zesty hint of chrematophobia.
What we have yet to explore is an accelerationist embrace, becoming as deeply, personally invested in capitalism as possible.
Meet Mike Merrill, the publicly traded person.




"Community through capitalism"
In January of 2008, Mike Merrill began selling shares of his life on the website/"personal decision making engine" KMikeyM.com.
Merrill calculated the time that his nights and weekends - the free time during which shareholders would be able to influence his activities for the forseeable future - as approximately worth $100,000, for an IPO of 100,000 shares. He sold his first 929 shares for $1 each, and the current price per share is $6.45 as of writing. With 11,235 shares currently held by 745 shareholders, Merrill still retains 88.77% of his personhood, but his shares are non-voting, giving the shareholders complete control over his decisions.
Shareholder decisions are publicly available and range from cosmetic choices such as whether to grow a mustache for the winter (rejected), to voting about voting, such as whether shareholders should have control of Merrill's dating life (approved), and possibly the most gut-wrenching, a proposal for whether or not Merrill should undergo a vasectomy (narrowly rejected by a margin of 69 shares).

Merrill has reached a level of oneness with his corporatization that allows him to enjoy the freedom of not making decisions

Writers for Playboy and Vice have called the project "corporate cosplay", to describe how Merrill co-opts the language and aesthetics of private enterprise, but due to the day-to-day nature of the project's intrusion into his life, it seems more like a longitudinal performance art piece than merely costuming.
Merrill admits that he is sometimes referred to as an artist, and whether or not the project is a massive performance art piece, it calls attention to the ways that free time and personal decisions are implicitly monetized, as well as the definition and valuation of individual "success."
Another artist, Jennifer Lyn Morone, Inc., created a similar structure for corporatizing her life in 2014, but although both projects involve the incorporation of personhood, their motivations are quite different. As the founder, CEO, shareholder, and product, JLM Inc. seeks the autonomy that businesses are given which human beings living in late capitalism are often denied: legal ownership of the self, including all data generated by "health, genetics, personality, capabilities, experience, potential, virtues and vices."
Merrill, on the other hand, has reached a level of oneness with his corporatization that allows him to enjoy the freedom of not making decisions, making the invisible hand of the market visible through his shareholders.
He writes: "By 'buying shares' in Mike Merrill you are in effect giving me money. In exchange, I am valuing your input on my choices based on how many of those shares you buy. As this mini-economy grows, my stock price will become a benchmark for my success; the higher the stock price, the more optimistic my shareholders are."



If the shareholders are happy, Mike is happy, and vice versa. Observing the fluctuations in his OHLC chart, it's been a bumpy ride for Merrill and the shareholder community over the last 10 years.
"My girlfriend... crashed the market in order gain more control. At the time it seemed like a romantic gesture."
MONTAG asked Merrill about some of these fluctuations, specifically a huge crash in the price in February of 2013, from trading near $10 at the end of January to $0.99:
"That particular drop was a bit of price manipulation. My girlfriend at the time was about to sign an Exclusive Relationship Contract that granted her options at whatever the price was at the time the shareholders approved that proposal. So she sold a few shares at a loss in order to force the price to dip, allowing her to buy 200 shares at a huge discount. Basically she crashed the market in order gain more control. At the time it seemed like a romantic gesture. Now I feel pretty neutral about it, as the relationship ended a few years later. We’ve since made the site so that you have to buy at the best available price, so that move is no longer possible."
It was after the coverage of the KMikeyM project on Radiotopia's Love and Radio podcast about how the project has specifically affected Merrill's romantic life, that we contacted Merrill in November of 2017 to find out how it affects his personal finances.
Even the decision to answer our interview questions was put to a vote, which passed with a unanimous Yes by 20 shareholders holding 1,763 shares.

1. Incorporate Self
2. ???
3. Profit?
The first thing everyone wants to know about the financial reality of the KMikeyM project is whether Merrill is making any money on it. He made it clear in a 2012 proposal about whether to invest the shareholders' money in stocks and bonds that all of the money was currently held in a low-yield savings account. We wanted to know how his stock price affects his personal finances, if at all, and exactly what happens when you buy a share of Mike. Merrill responded candidly:
"In 2013 I was on the Today Show and hundreds of people came and bought shares. To buy shares you have to deposit money and I’m not a company, you’re just buying votes to control my life, so all the money goes into my account. I then have to report it as income and pay taxes on it. I’m still about $14,000 in debt to the IRS for my taxes in 2013. But the IRS is great about allowing me to have a payment plan, so I pay $215 per month minimum.
I feel like a fraud in that I represent some version of financial intelligence when really I’ve just been flying by the seat of my pants, being buried and then crawling out, over and over again. I present as the epitome of the Warren Buffett wunderkind but really I’m just a fucking idiot who ended up 14K in debt to the IRS because I don’t know how money works. But I learned a little from that experience!
While the project has been a financial burden it also has allowed me to do things I wouldn’t have otherwise. The shareholders allowed me to live on the sale of shares for a few months while I was starting a new company, and obviously I’ve had opportunities like being able to walk on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange that I would not have had otherwise. I feel pretty lucky to have this community of people who are working on this project with me.
It’s weird to have money in my account I can’t spend. Shareholders have deposited money and can withdraw it at any time (just yesterday someone liquidated their position and I sent them $956.46). I only make money when I sell new shares into the market, which happens once a year."
While that vote (to invest in stocks and bonds using Betterment) was rejected, we asked whether Merrill explored any more elaborate alternative investment systems, and his opinion on cryptocurrency. Merrill says he loves it, and has been touting it since 2013. "One of my favorite things about it is the desire by pundits to declare that it is revolutionary or a total fraud. It’s neither of those, or maybe it’s both? I think everyone should buy like $20 of some cryptocurrency and then send some to a friend, just to understand how it works."
So while the response was positive, don't expect a KMIKEYM-Coin ICO any time soon.
We also asked Mike about some other specific votes that may have impacted his personal finances: the 2009 proposal to launch another web project called "Money Blog," with the intended goal to make $1,000.00 off of the site; a 2017 vote on whether to engage in brand ambassadorship for the hot sauce Wet Wizard, a vote about whether to subscribe to Spotify or not, and a vote on whether to employ a personal finance coach to eliminate personal debt.
The personal debt project is still ongoing, and Merrill wrote that he has paid off almost $17,000 of credit card debt with the help of Oh My Dollar's Lillian Karabaic.
Money Blog, "was an early attempt at embracing the ecommerce trends of the internet and while it was a failure the idea of it is still very compelling. On the one hand you have Amazon trying to sell everything to you from one single source, and on the other hand you have these specialized stores trying to seek you out via intense targeting campaigns hoping to hook you into a purchase. Even though it’s big vs. small it’s not good vs. evil. A lot of times the small sellers are a 1000 times more sleazy and dark than the company that eats everything."
"I like the idea of being 'friends' with a brand on social media and treating this strange artificial construct like a real person."
When asked whether through his experience with Wet Wizard, he would call himself an "influencer," and if so, who his audience would be, Merrill stressed that while he respects the work that influencers do and loves working with brands and companies ("I like the idea of being 'friends' with a brand on social media and treating this strange artificial construct like a real person."), that his relationship with his shareholders is nothing like entertaining an audience: "I don’t have an audience, I have shareholders. It’s a different kind of relationship. It’s still one to many, but I take my shareholders into account on every decision I make, even if I don’t put it up for a vote."

We are your friends
The intimate relationship Merrill has with his shareholders bled into many of Merrill's answers. We asked Merrill what he could tell us about his top shareholders, the people who hold the most sway over his life decisions, who go by the names aaronpk, Josh Berezin, and Douglas Dollars on the trading site.
"I always describe Aaron, my biggest shareholder, as an ethical technologist. He’s a developer who chooses to work on fundamental issues of ownership and identity on the web. He is the developer of the KmikeyM software and he also built weejee, a group decision making platform designed to replicate some of the benefits of KmikeyM. Aaron and I have a friendship that is based on a shared love of projects, and I’m in awe of his ability to create just about anything you can imagine in software.
I’ve known Josh since I was 14 years old. We grew up together in Alaska and I suspect he knows me better than I know myself. My friendship with Josh is very active and he’s likely the smartest person I know, so I turn to him often when I’m facing a dilemma. I trust Josh to call me out when I’m doing something wrong.
Douglas Dollars and I have never met in person. He could be a serial killer trying to take over my life like the Talented Mr. Ripley… I have no idea. I mean, I know a little about him him because like me he puts a lot of himself out on the internet. He’s actually a great example of the greatest power of the KmikeyM project. It acts as a beacon of like-minded people and gives them a way to interact not just with me, but with each other.
On the other hand, he’s one of my biggest shareholders and I have no idea about his actual motivations or how he’ll vote. This is a man who has more say in my life than my family. There is some fear around that, but mostly excitement. I want to find all the Douglas Dollarses in the world!"
(Through a little bit of cyber-stalking, MONTAG found more information about the elusive Douglas Dollars, but that's a story for another article.)
Merrill's vulnerability - how his worth is determined by other peoples' literal investment in him, whether these people have his best interests in mind or not - turns out to be the most fascinating part of the project. After a March vote called Misuse of Executive Power revealed to the stakeholders that he was in the process of buying a house without their input and was seeking alternative solutions to make big life decisions, and later in 2017, making the choice to accept a job and move to Los Angeles without prior shareholder approval, it seemed like the KMikeyM project was on the decline.
We asked Mike if he saw himself moving away from letting shareholders make major life decisions, or if his relationship with them would deepen again, and whether he saw the project as sustainable ten years on:
"I was in a bad place for a while and I credit the shareholders for bringing me out of it. I had separated my life into these two distinct halves, my personal life and my KmikeyM life. The problem was I wasn’t really happy with either of them, but bouncing between kept me occupied for a while. When the shareholders started objecting to the house purchase it was the first sign I had really screwed up, but I still wasn’t able to fix it. As things got worse in my personal life I got depressed and was really searching for some solid ground. I’d been fantasizing about moving to Los Angeles for years and took the plunge at a time when I was ready to just throw in the towel on KmikeyM. I was in a bad spot.
But with a fresh start in a new city I was able to also re-engage with my shareholders. It’s not perfect yet, but the last eight months of being here I think my relationship with the shareholders is the strongest it’s been in four or five years. It feels good, and based on the uptick in the stock price it feels good to them too."

Release
While we could leave the KMikeyM story on that happy note, with everyone feeling slightly better about their lives and stock prices soaring, it feels important to again touch upon what seems to be the moral of the whole project: giving in.
In the words of Mike Merrill, "You can oppose capitalism, that's great, people do that to various levels of success, but why fight it was sort of my question, why not just engage it all the way?"
Merrill is a fan of catharsis, of leaning in to the unpleasant for the moment of release. When we asked him about the Spotify subscription vote, he recalled in detail how he found a song that makes him cry (semi-ironically, a cover of No Woman No Cry).



"The first time I heard this it came up from the algorithm while I was alone in my apartment. It just stopped me and I stood there listening to it while feelings of sadness welled up inside me. Since I was alone I just let myself start crying. When it ended I was trying to figure out what about it made me feel that way and I couldn’t think of anything specific.
Later that week I was stuck in traffic in LA and as an experiment I put the song on repeat and it still made me cry. Over and over again I listened to it while barely moving in traffic and was at times sobbing and weeping and I started to find a pattern in which parts really hit me and how I anticipated those parts and even when I knew it was coming it was just like an overwhelming feeling of sadness.
That experience was pretty exhausting."
But isn't it all exhausting? The rat race. The fight for autonomy against corporate entities that want to control or predict your every move. The constant questioning of self-quantification, the time you have no control over, and whether the time that you do have control over is being used to the fullest. Whether you're succeeding, and figuring out what success even means.
Mike Merrill may have figured something out about giving up, relinquishing control, and staring unblinkingly into the maw of capitalism - and about what it means to be a person in the 21st century, hurtling towards the future.

If you’ve been noticing a trend toward [interactive storytelling within the VR space it’s because it’s been listing that way for a long time. Putting you at the centre of whatever it is you want to be doing has always been VR's raison d'etre but this trend in moving beyond gaming and into other forms of video entertainment. Sean Fleming looks at how this is just the beginning, and how in the future, those episodes of Game of Thrones you binge-watched last night might not make sense to anyone but you...


“...Reality, however utopian, is something from which people feel the need of taking pretty frequent holidays....” - Aldous Huxley

You're probably tired of hearing about how VR is going to usher us into a whole new era of storytelling. In fairness, it is easy to get excited about VR in this, or any, context. VR, as discussed frequently here on MONTAG, is freakin’ amazing.
So all hail VR, the medium of the future: hoist it aloft and parade it through the streets and we, the users, shall cheer, throw confetti, and revel in religious ecstasy.
Because what is beginning now with VR are the first signs of the oppressive shackles of OLD storytelling falling in bunches around our feet.

It's all about you
via GIPHY
At ComicCon last year, MTV hosted an unusual preview of Teen Wolf that featured interactive VR storytelling and put the subject at the centre of the trailer.
Putting on the VR headset allows characters to address you directly, and looking at different areas of the trailer triggered different plot directions. Even in this simple example, it’s pretty incredible as a technical feat, and as a future storytelling tool it feels transformative.



Being addressed as a character wasn’t what interested me as much as my actions influencing the scene itself.
The ability for your own choices to make a difference to what you experience is wildly powerful: it’s what could elevate VR above simple 360° movies, naff 3D films, or painfully average Artaud theatre productions of Sarah Kane’s 4.48 Psychosis.

Post-viewer
via GIPHY
Changes in tech influence how entertainment is produced and then consumed (remember 3D TV... anyone?). Australian development house Start VR is a studio that’s pushing VR as a sort of post-cinematic medium.
Their 360-film VR-Noir is an initial demonstration of the crossover potential of film and gaming, and how it could fundamentally change how consume film. In VR-Noir, events of the film are driven by you, the viewer.
Perhaps “viewer” is a misnomer in this instance, as you are simultaneously both viewer and instigator – as you ask questions and take control of surveillance equipment. Sure, VR-Noir is a little patchy – it's not going to win any Olivier Awards anytime soon – but as an exploration of how we can consume media in the future, it is as compelling an example as you’ll find.
MansLaughter is another variant where VR experiences, storytelling, and theatre are combined as an interactive thriller in a VR space. And where your experience in Teen Wolf depends on where you look, Manslaughter demands repeat viewing.
Watching films again – to catch the stuff you missed the first time around, or to discover nuance, or digging deeper into a character – is about to get a lot more time consuming and enjoyable with the advent of multiple narratives.

DIY Director's Cut



And it's not just visual storytelling that’s getting the bespoke treatment. We tend to regard music as a static piece of art that's to be heard over and over - but of course, until the invention of recording and playback devices, a song evolved and changed each time it was performed.
Trip-hop superstars Massive Attack attempted to bridge this gap when they released new music bundled inside their “reactive music” app Fantom in 2016. The app didn’t deliver these new songs in a “final mix:” instead it mixed and reformed songs on the fly, based on external variables such as the listener’s location, movement, time of day, heartbeat and the integral moving image camera.
Fantom was a quietly remarkable paradigm shift: a major artist releasing songs that would be heard for the first time in a unique way to each listener. No big reveal at the MTV VMAs, no exclusive radio plays.
In Fantom, every play is an exclusive, for each listener.
via GIPHY
This is not so dissimilar to the app that tailors music to your heartbeat. Both apps are born from a desire to make music reactive to us, and not the other way around.
I wrote previously about the rise in wearable tech and lifelogging and if you were to combine the interactive nature of VR storytelling with the reactive bio-influence of user data then we end up somewhere very interesting indeed.
Because what happens when you’re not just actively influencing the narrative? What happens when your vitals and psyche starts making a difference - the stuff you can’t control?

Here’s where your subconscious starts dictating the action.
via GIPHY
In the future, movies could play you like a fiddle. Horror movies ramping the tension as your heartbeat starts to resemble a coked-out middle aged marketing manager? Or cortisol detection algorithms to reduce stress by pushing the narrative into relaxation phase?
If you’ve seen the episode of Black Mirror where an unwitting character signs up to test a brain implant AR video game experience, you’ll appreciate how allowing virtual monsters born from your deepest fears into your life may not be the wisest idea. Spoiler alert: it all ends in tears.
via GIPHY
When entertainment does become an individual experience – one truly tailored to you – how will that affect people like me who like to talk about film? What happens to the fabled watercooler chatter when everyone's experience is different? You’d have to retell the story as it appeared to you.
Perhaps a new type of post-viewing bond will form: one from experiencing something familiar, but different. Some people bond over bad movies. It's a trashy approach to movie-watching, specifically intended to spark conversation and an experience beyond the movie.
So what if you could watch a film again, but this time, the version influenced by the inner workings of the mind of your best friend Barry – the one who’s obsessed with World War II memorabilia?
via GIPHY
Maybe discussion and understanding will blossom when we have truly interesting things to say: it's easy to explain plot points that are totally in tune with the way our brains work.
Wait, there’s a thought: what if your predilections were so effectively reflected in a personalised movie that something was generated that you’d be reluctant to share with anybody else? The post-screening conversations might reveal a little more of you than you’d like: “What, you mean it was only me who had three hours of racist jokes?”
Perhaps a desire to subdue any fetishes or thoughts you’d like to keep private might become a priority as a whole new form of insecurity is born.
You might have loved the “gimp scene” in Pulp Fiction but you might not be so keen on sharing it if this plotline had been zapped directly from your cerebral cortex.
Perhaps the most interesting films will be borne from the least interesting people.




OK, it’s all a little hard to swallow. Storytelling that reflects what we’re feeling on the fly is surely a long way away. But just remember:  we now find it odd to watch film without sound, or have a live piano player scoring the film we watch: but this was once bleeding edge visual entertainment way back when.
Future audiences may look at the way we currently watch stuff and laugh at the quaint nature of it all, as they don their VR headsets and become Jason fucking Bourne, running down a staircase as the camera swings around as if operated by a drunken clown. The Lumière brothers would be proud.
VR is already a powerful agent of change in the world of movies - and it’s clear to see how it could be applied to any kind of storytelling.
The question that you now should ask yourself is: do you want your stories to guide you, or vice-versa?

MONTAG SHORT FICTION #008
MONTAG publishes curious short fiction, exploring our strange future and what it will feel like when we get there. They take the technology you're interested in as a starting point and show where it might take us. The stories are outré, evocative, and atypical; they're also closer to today than you think.
We're now surrounded by easy-access information and questions are answered in moments thanks to the ubiquity of internet-connected smartphones. In the this fictional future of Rijnkileak, information can be stored directly onto chips implanted in the brain – but what happens if that information gets corrupted?


Born July 15, 1606, in Leiden, in the Dutch Republic now known as the Netherlands, as the ninth child of his family.

Of course I got the chip.
I was so excited not to have to carry a huge ugly backpack like a turtle and exacerbate my scoliosis – and those wheeled backpacks look so lame.

His mother was Roman Catholic and came from a family of bakers, and his father was a miller who belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church.

I pirated my textbooks, we all did.
Information is wicked expensive, and we told our parents that we could share them, or borrow them from the library.

He apprenticed with the artist Jacob van Swanenburgh and was also a student of Pieter Lastman.

I had a major migraine right after they put it in, it hurt like hell, but they said that was normal.
A day after, the pain went away, and they said I could start uploading.

He opened his first art studio at 19 and began teaching at the age of 21.

Their faces flash through my mind constantly: those dark, earthy backgrounds; the chiaroscuro; pale dutch faces with ruddy potato noses and pointed beards floating above lacy ruffs and under big black hats.

In 1631 he moved to the city of Amsterdam where he started his professional career painting portraits.

I remember that afternoon I went to a shake shack with friends.
Emily got the chip too, and she helped me braid my hair to cover the patch of scalp they shaved to put in my implant behind my right ear.
We laughed about how much easier it was going to be for us to get into college - we could learn in our sleep!

Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq, also known as The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch, 363 cm by 437 cm, completed 1642, is his most celebrated work.

I set up Transmission that night before bed and clicked into my uploading port for the first time.
The Life and Works of Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was streaming in from a network of unknown peers, and would finish downloading in time for art history class the next day.

The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp depicts the Dutch surgeon and the later mayor of Amsterdaman Dr. Nicolaes tulp holding an anatomy lesson on the corpse of the executed criminal Aris Kindt. 216.5 cm by 169.5 cm, completed in 1632

I shouldn’t have been so calm about letting strangers’ raw data in my head.
But it was surprisingly easy to get to sleep while packets of information streamed in.

The Storm on the Sea of Galilee is his only known seascape and a brilliant example of his propensity for biblical themes, 160 cm by 128 cm, completed 1633

I woke up and knew I had a leak: his face was all I could see in my mind’s eye.
He’s holding his palette and brushes, with his weird crumpled off-white cap; looking at once both stoic and jolly.
Scholars now believe, by analyzing 36 of his almost 100 self-portraits, that he suffered from stereo blindness.

Self-portrait, 1629, 44cm by 34 cm; Self-portrait wearing a white feathered bonnet, 1635, 90.5 cm by 71.8 cm; Self-portrait with beret and turned-up collar, 1659, 84.4 cm by 66 cm

It doesn’t really bother me. I'm not going to go crazy or anything.
It’s kind of like having an earworm, or a song stuck in your head.

In 1634, he married his art dealer Hendrik van Uylenburgh’s cousin (although some sources say she was his niece) Saskia van Uylenburgh.

But obviously I couldn’t tell my parents I’d been pirating straight to my chip, they’d freak.
And they say everyone’s a little leaky, they’re still working on figuring out how to keep data from flowing freely between the chip and brain reliably.
I’m sure when I upgrade I’ll stop involuntarily regurgitating information.

Died October 4, 1669, outliving his wife and only son.

At least, I hope so.

It’s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year. Tis’ The Season To Be Jolly. Merry Christmas Everybody. Christmas is coming. It’s inescapable. And it sounds like you’re gonna be happy about it whether you want to be or not.Happiness and Christmas are joined at the hip and, of course, a cynic would say that the Christmas season is one long parade of commercially-enforced fun. MONTAG strongly opposes this view. In our extremely humble opinion, Christmas is indeed the happiest time of the year, and we suspect that those who don’t like Christmas are the same people who don’t like French fries or chocolate. That is to say: they are simply wrong.And while there are limits to the saccharine-soaked happiness-overload that is Christmas in 2018 - novelty Christmas jumpers-for-two with a vague charitable impact being the new low point in the Ugly Christmas Jumper Wars - all evidence points to most people believing that, when celebrating Christmas, more is very much more.Look at the evidence. Chocolate makes people happy - so at Christmas, people buy enormous quantities of it. Deliberately awful Christmas clothing has, indefensibly, become a thing that makes almost everyone smile, and thus there is now a multi-million-dollar industry around making nylon sweaters with - oh, I don’t know - a naked Santa and the words “I have a big package for you” on them.And then there’s Christmas movies. People hold certain movies so closely to their hearts that watching them becomes a yearly Christmas ritual, with the likes of It’s A Wonderful Life, Love Actually, and - as everyone who shares an office with That Guy knows - Die Hard dusted off and dutifully played. But there is an insatiable lust for more. More movies. We want them. We need them. As many as you can shovel onto Netflix. And there’s a vast industry ready to quench our thirst with a mountain of made-for-TV Christmas movies, all guaranteed to bring happiness into your life, and all as warm, comfy and safe as - well, a Christmas jumper.In the last decade or so, a Christmas-Movie-Industrial-Complex has sprung up, capitalising on our craving for any 90-minute series of moving images involving a sprinkling of fake snow, a red or green colour scheme and a suspiciously-professionally-decorated tree - as long as the story is twee, slightly moralistic and features a 90’s children’s TV star you’d forgotten all about.Chief Elf in the supply chain is the Hallmark corporation, who have proven especially adept at creating hundreds of Christmas-themed movies that are all vaguely similar, yet are gobbled up by a ravenous public. In 2018, Hallmark’s TV channels will broadcast a scarcely-believable 34 brand new Christmas movies, all with titles that promise - and deliver - exactly what you think they will. Here’s a selection of Hallmark Christmas Movie classics that you too can luxuriate in:• Crown for Christmas - featuring Hallmark’s contract star Danica McKellar, from 90’s kids TV show The Wonder Years, this movie is a hybrid offering: combining a story from the long line of poor-girl-is-wooed-by-a-real-life-prince movies with CHRISTMAS. In this case, Danica is a poor maid (of course) and the prince is the - no sniggering please - King of Winshire.• Northpole - starring Tiffany Thiessen from 90’s kids TV show Saved By The Bell, this movie is the staggeringly obvious story of a plucky single mom being wooed by a nice hunky man in time for Christmas, thanks to the magical intervention of Santa himself. Naturally, such heartwarming unsubtlety means that - correctly - this is a Hallmark smash hit.• My Christmas Dream - featuring Hallmark’s contract star Danica McKellar, from 90’s kids TV… wait - just how many Christmas TV movies has Danica been in? (The answer is at least seven, probably more) Anyway, here, she plays a career-driven woman who has to choose between the man of her dreams and the work opportunity of a lifetime. At Christmas. So delightfully identikit are these movies that “Christmas movie posters with white heterosexual couples wearing red and green” is not merely an observable trope - it’s a solid marketing strategy and operational plan: these movies are made precisely this way, on purpose, in the summer, in bulk, in Canada, in the snow, on repeat.So what are people seeking when they gulp down identical Christmas movie after identical Christmas movie? At the most happy time of the year, have we discovered that the root of happiness itself is the movie equivalent of a Pumpkin Spice latte held by someone who was once in an episode of Baywatch Nights?  Is what we really seek in life to see hunky and/or babelicious actors chew the scenery through endless meet-cutes whilst wearing Christmas hats?Apparently so. To find out for sure, MONTAG curled up on the sofa, wrapped itself in a fleecy blanket, gripped a bucket of hot chocolate with both hands, and analysed a few key masterpieces to find out: what is happiness, according to made-for-TV Christmas movies?Happiness is… Hunky, laid-back men who subvert uptight people’s worldview… at Christmas! In The Most Wonderful Time of the Year (2009), there are two loud messages: women need men to be happy, and happiness is not found in possessions, except that actually… it is! And yet, MONTAG found itself willing to ignore these dubious starting points because this movie stars The Fonz. Yes, Henry Winkler, AKA the world’s nicest man, provides literally all of the warmth in this adorably generic story of a Very Professional She-EO, played by Baywatch Hawaii’s Brooke Burns. Her hatred of both a) Christmas, and b) letting loose is tested by a Sexy-Firefighter-Calendar-type hunk who, if you squint a bit, looks like a cross between Melted Tom Cruise and Careworn Jason Bateman. He couldn’t, of course, be more different to our heroine: he has no real plan, but does have lots of older-than-his-years Very Sage Advice to share with her.Through a series of entirely predictable circumstances, we learn that Sometimes Letting Life Just Happen is better than being An Uptight Woman. We also learn that having lots of money and possessions isn’t important - except for the extended sub-plot which involves obtaining a must-have Christmas toy, and culminates in a straight-up felony, when Laid-Back Hunky Guy knocks a toy store owner unconscious with a trash can, while Uptight Career Woman gurgles in love-addled, liberated delight.Number of times the leading lady accidentally sees the Hunky man shirtless and stumbles over her words as she realises she is in love with him: one.Get You A Man Who Can Do Both: FYI - women need both a cuddly uncle *and* a Man With No Plan.Key Learning: Put the Fonz in any move for an instant 70% lift in happiness.Happiness is… Stockholm Syndrome! 2007’s Holiday in Handcuffs is another movie that asks us to embrace a jailable offence in the name of Christmassy love. Melissa Joan Hart - star of 90's kids' TV show Clarissa Explains It All, plays a ditzy, artsy waitress lamenting that she “has nothing to offer” her parents - “no husband, no grandchildren” - who are waiting for her to arrive in the family homestead with a man in tow. Sporting what may or may not be one of Ru Paul’s curly blonde wigs, Clarissa Explains Away her problem by kidnapping, at gunpoint, 90's kids' TV star Mario Lopez from Saved By The Bell.Despite being held hostage and almost having his Christmas baubles destroyed by a stray crotch-level bullet, the uptight, high-flying businessman Lopez falls in love with his captor via a series of Christmassy events including ice-skating, snowball fighting, and aborted escape plans thwarted by freezing snow.Number of times the leading lady accidentally sees the Hunky man shirtless and stumbles over her words as she realises she is in love with him: one.Amount That Clarissa Explains: probably not enough to satisfy the local cops.Key Learning: Happiness is a warm gun.Happiness is… DESTROYING your bitter rival in a bake-off (and by nabbing the hunky single dad first)In the Hallmark Channel universe where every movie is substantially identical, a Christmas movie named A Cookie Cutter Christmas is surely some sort of meta-joke that slipped through the net. In fact the whole movie is some sort of meta-analysis of capitalism itself, depicting the struggles of cute ’n’ plucky singleton Christie in her battle with her too-perfect nemesis penny, played by Miranda Frigon from 90's Kids' TV show, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show.Generic Hunky Single Dad James, who looks a bit like Bryan Cranston in a fairground mirror, enrols his daughter at a new school and - in a gross breach of tutor-student child protection protocol - her teachers Christie and Penny then battle for his affections. Their plight revolves around competing in capitalist zero-sum games of the traditionally female-only "Baking" and "Winning The Man To Ensure Her Happiness" kind. Only one of them can win, while the other will be SHAMED before an audience of her peers: a pitifully man-less losing baker. Who could possibly win?Number of times the leading lady accidentally sees the Hunky man shirtless and stumbles over her words as she realises she is in love with him: one.Hallmark Movie Not To Be Mistaken With: Christmas Cookies. Key Learning: The way to man’s heart is through his stomach, plus also by using his six year old daughter as collateral.Truly, it's impossible to watch Hallmark's christmas movies and not feel strong pangs of happiness, seasonal delight, or mouth the word "Awwwwwwww" quietly to oneself. We are the dogs, and Hallmark are our owners, dangling treats that we are hard-wired to sit down and beg for. It's also hard not to watch these movies and risk your eyes rolling right out of your head, but Hallmark are onto something, and are in no rush to change the system. "We purposely look to be an escape. We try not to be issues-oriented in terms of creating polarizing conversations,” says Hallmark’s VP of Marketing, and here, MONTAG cannot disagree with their intent: as long as you keep our Xmas Synapses tingling, we'll take all of what you've got.(Oh, and we'd like another Melissa Joan Hart/Dean Cain Christmas Classic, please!)

Video games are art
The statement "video games are art" has been hotly debated for at least the last seven years. In 2010, Roger Ebert (yes, film critic Roger Ebert) famously wrote a screed arguing that "video games can never be art".
Ebert believes "No one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great poets, filmmakers, novelists... painters, composers, and so on."
Part of his essay was in response to a TEDX talk by game creator Kelly Santiago, who argues that video games should be considered art and uses examples of games like Flower, which was inducted into the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2013.


Still from Flower via the Smithsonian American Art Museum

But are video games only art if they ∗extremely Indiana Jones voice∗ belong in a museum? Of course not! Art is for everybody.
Twine games provide a platform for people to make games who don't have game development companies behind them, may not be able to write a single line of code, but can still create beautiful, immersive, moving experiences that we can argue are worthy of comparison with works of art (sorry, Ebert).
The accessibility of these tools and the increased visibility of indie games on platforms such as itch.io have been huge for democratizing the art of video games for creators and players. Let's explore some titles, bask in the beauty of the genre, and maybe even find something to play next.

Twine after twine
Originally created by Chris Klimasin in 2009, Twine calls itself "an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories."
Much like the hypertext fiction that we explored authors on Twitter creating, Twine games use the technology of the browser (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and take advantage of the games' clickability to let the player work their way into and through the world they create.
Unlike earlier text-based games like MUDs, Twines can include illustrations, embedded videos, often have soundtracks, and are usually played solo. However, there are many (like Mighty Owlbear's The Road To Adventure) that draw on the language of these early games, using directions like "Go North. Go South." to explore.
They're games made by and for people who love games and are familiar with tropes from MUDs, RPGs, JRPGs, survival games, and visual novels, as well as pop cultural influences that aren't reflected often in games (such as Crystal Warrior Ke$ha, the story of an epic magical battle fought by the pop singer).


Screenshot from Crystal Warrior Ke$ha

Mechanics-wise, you are always clicking on hyperlinks to advance through the story. Sleep is used as a narrative device in many text-based games, which take place over the course of days or weeks, and you may have to return to a certain page to do this. Once you find whatever action, like sleeping or exploring, moves the story forward, it's tempting to race through these games, but you'll find that actions taken will often have an effect on the outcome of the story and that Twine stories almost always have multiple endings.
It's unclear if B.J. Best's Unofficial Sea-Monkey(R) Simulation was actually built on Twine, but it's a great example. It opens with the Don DeLillo quote: "All plots tend to move deathward," and uses a chronological mechanic of interacting with your sea monkey colony every day to tell a story of child in a less than ideal home situation, with eight possible endings.
The genre and contents of games on Twine are diverse, but more often than not they explore personal problems and themes that aren't touched upon in mainstream games, art, or literature. The authors of Twine games are generally people whose stories aren't told at all through traditional media; gender non-conforming artists, minorities, and people telling stories from a neurodivergent perspective. They also often have content warnings for themes like abuse, assault, self harm, and substance abuse.

Yes, of course I am sick of my dumb human body

One of the most well-known games created with Twine is Zoë Quinn's "Depression Quest." The game illustrates the struggle of performing everyday tasks with depression and "aims to show other sufferers of depression that they are not alone in their feelings, and to illustrate to people who may not understand the illness the depths of what it can do to people." It's one of the most well-known examples in the genre of empathy games, which let you embody someone else's experience through the gameplay.
In the realm of indie games, the authors are often acknowledging their struggles with their own bodies and minds, and how they've used others' games and outlets in art and media to cope. In SABBAT: DIRECTOR'S KVT, developer ohnoproblems' extended version of the game SABBAT, they ask straight up:

"have you ever gotten sick of your dumb human body and depressing future prospects? why not play through a twine story in which you can coat your body in charged animal essences and enact satanic rituals to gain weird demonic body parts and terrible power?" 

The answer to which is Yes, of course I am sick of my dumb human body, and virtually amassing demonic power through Satanic rituals sounds like a very fun way to spend an evening.
As you may have guessed by now, there are also many games that cater to more unusual sexual proclivities. A popular vore-themed game, Devour Comfort, is about resting inside the belly of a dragon. In the disclaimer on itch.io, they state:

"This is a SOFT VORE game - no teeth, no biting, no blood, no messiness, and no digestion. Much like Jonah inside the whale, should you succeed, you'll eventually just be spit right back out - in an entirely non-gross fashion, I promise." 

Of course being eaten alive isn't what gets most people's gears going, but it's really cool that there are people creating media for people who it does!
It's also a great genre of games for people like us here at MONTAG, who want to think way too much about technology and the future. Cyberpunks, start your engines:

Heartscapes and Quick Faves
These are all games from just a few of our favorite creators that have to do with technology, humanity, and the future of both.
Porpentine Charity Heartscape is one of my favorite visual artists and game creators. These two Porpentine stories told through only text, colored links, and blocks of gradient color with ambient soundtracks are a testament to how complete her world-building is and how immersive a game told only through the browser can be.



Screenshots from With Those We Love Alive

With Those We Love Alive tells the story of an artificer brought into the court of a cruel empress (mine wears majestic ram horns, a mantle of flesh rags, her eyes burning with cold fire) and the arrival of someone you thought you would never see again. Themes include fantasy, magical artifacts, denial, identity, trauma, and loyalty.


Screenshot from Vesp

Vesp: A History of Sapphic Scaphism is a "vespo-sapphic pesticidepunk UV romance thriller." In a cyberpunk dystopia overrun with deadly, venomous wasps, the protagonist struggles in therapy sessions with the overwhelming desire to identify with and become one with this threat to civilization. She aids a terrorist attack against the city in the wasps' favor which throws it into pesticide-drenched chaos, ushering in the age of insects. Themes include society, monstrosity, gender, madness, death, contagion, eroticism, devotion, transaction, empathy and hallucination.


Screenshot from Queered Static

Queered Static by @RiotJayne is a beautiful mashup of found glitch art and a narrative about trans issues and anxiety ("with a little trans erotica thrown in for good measure.") It's very much NSFW, but if you enjoy queer stories and net aesthetics it's a quick must-play.


Screenshot from ARC

ARC is a black and green pure text story about being a cyborg and doing some crime:
"The Minos job was supposed to be easy money, especially for someone with your skills and cybernetic hardware. So naturally, the mission was an ambush, your boss might be out to screw you, and a hacker you've never even met is in your head. But you're going to need her help to get through this."
If you haven't had enough of Better Bodies and thinking about all the cool things we could do with networked eyes and super robot legs, you'll love it.


Screenshot from Recipe for Love

The last recommended game is called Recipe for Love, in which a robot has rented you (hello, gig economy!) to teach it what love is. The illustrations are unsettlingly adorable, it's super short and SFW.
These are just a few of our faves, and you can find hundreds more Twine games for any identity, interest, or fetish on itch.io. If you have any game recommendations, interesting Twines, or just want to shout about whether videos games are art or not, email us at montag@getgrover.com.

It's almost gauche to express a platitude like "music connects us all", yet the universal nature of music is truly astonishing. It doesn't matter if you're a music maker tapping away on Native Instruments gear in a  dark room, an aficionado with neighbour-bothering speakers or simply someone who just likes something pleasant playing through their bluetooth headphones – we all hanker after music. But why?
Kathryn Lawrence finds out that our brains are hard-wired to respond to music in certain predictable ways – and that we can hack our brains with sound...

Music can do some powerful things: make your toes tap, hips sway, or hack your brain.
No, this isn't about ear worms, which feel like a sonic DDoS attack. It's about using the power of music to change your brain state.
Throbbing 100 Hz beats may not be topping the charts any time soon, (but some people listen to weirder ambient sounds in the basement techno clubs of Berlin, and call that music...).  These sound-based technological experiments are designed to change your brain state or induce different feelings: from subliminal messages in pop music, to binaural beats and ASMR, soft brain hacking tech is here with the power of music.
Mind Control Music
The trope of Mind Control Music describes music that can induce a hypnotic state or propel the listener to perform some kind of behavior through subliminal messages. Descended from stories dating as far back as the Sirens of Greek mythology, or the Middle Ages' cautionary tale of the Pied Piper, they illustrate the compelling power of music. But can it really hack your body and mind?
Fundamentalist Christian groups have long professed the belief that rock music influences bad behavior, going so far as to say that it causes teens to worship the devil. After the 1990 case against Judas Priest, who were sued for supposedly including backmasked messages urging suicide on one of their albums, psychologists have taken on serious study of whether subliminal messaging in music, via backwards messages or other means, is possible.
In a chapter of 2005's Psychological Sketches entirely dedicated to subliminal messages, John Vokey from the University of Lethbridge found "simply no evidence for effective subliminal persuasion in film or video, advertising, self-help audiotapes, or rock music, and there is certainly no theoretical basis to expect it."
Of course, the opinions of psychologists will never stop the endless tide of conspiracy theorists trying to find evidence of attempts at mass brainwashing in every new pop music release.
Katy Perry's most recent summer hit, "Chained To The Rhythm," while hilariously straightforward in its messaging about being self-aware of the mind-numbing effects of pop music always urging us to spend money, strive to procreate, and submit our wills to the machine of capitalism, may have a grain of truth in it.



A study presented at the 2012 Society for Neuroscience meeting found that groups that are exposed to the same rhythmic sounds not only move together in rhythm, but also think in rhythm together. Using EEG monitoring of brain wave oscillations, they found that after a short time their brain waves would sync with the rhythmic beat, peaking at the same time (this effect is also called brainwave entrainment.)
It may not be as obvious an influence as flashing signs saying "Eat popcorn" and "Drink Coca-Cola" but could be used to facilitate communication and cooperation among large groups.
Sound Waves & Brain Waves: The Science
There are five types of brain waves that most people emit regularly during normal brain activities (like living, sleeping, working, etc.): alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and theta waves.
Gamma waves have the highest frequency, from 40 to 100 Hz, and are important for learning, memory, and information processing. Next are beta waves, between 12 and 40 Hz, used for critical thinking, reading, writing, and socializing. Alpha waves, between 8 Hz and 12 Hz, are emitted when relaxing, and theta waves, between 4 and 8 Hz are emitted during sleep or creative activities. Finally delta waves, the slowest, between 0 and 4 Hz, are emitted during deep sleep, and are essential to unconscious bodily functions like heartbeat and digestion.
Essentially, the idea behind brain hacking with sound waves is that you can expose your brain to frequencies that will cause it to produce more of one of these types of waves due to the entrainment phenomenon.
And how do those frequencies get to your brain? Through your ears of course!
Binaural audio has been the focus of many studies (see Auditory Beat Stimulation and its Effects on Cognition And Mood States and Binaural beat technology in humans: a pilot study to assess neuropsychologic, physiologic, and electroencephalographic effects among others) that attempt to treat anxiety, depression, ADHD, or support claims of binaural beats for controlling and enhancing brain power. The theory is that when you play an audio track in each ear with a slightly different frequency, your brain itself produces a tone in between the two frequencies to compensate, and that in doing so, you produce brain waves of that frequency.
Although this effect has yet to be definitively proven, people use binaural beats to improve their concentration while studying, quickly achieve a state of meditation, or even produce altered, drug-like states.
ASMR & Braingasms
Another barely-explained audio-induced phenomenon that has been sweeping the internet is ASMR, short for the autonomous sensory meridian response. This formal name for the feeling, introduced in 2010, refers to a tingling sensation on the scalp, neck, and sometimes back, while listening to soft sounds such as whispering, paper crinkling, tapping, and many others. Often there is an element of role play, as other common triggers include hair cutting, massage, and other grooming-related relaxing activities.



Often recordings used to induce the "brain orgasm" of ASMR are recorded binaurally, so that users wearing headphones can hear the proximity and direction of the sounds, which enhances the effect.
And although many ASMR triggers are associated with intimacy, such as speaking softly or lightly stroking objects, members of the ASMR community insist that the experience is not sexual. For a non-tingler, these videos which are intended to help you relax, produce a euphoric sensation, or get to sleep faster, can seem fetishistic or unsettling in their specificity. But when it works, it really works, as evidenced by the almost one million subscribers to the most popular "ASMRtist" on YouTube, Gentle Whispering.



Soft Brain Hacking

Try it now and feel the power of music

While it may take some special circumstances, or a lot more research into how and why the brain responds to music and auditory stimulation, we know enough to make an effort towards designing music that not only feels, but also sounds good. This is the goal of the Sync Project: along with Manchester's Marconi Union, they are attempting to create the world's most relaxing music. Using a smartphone app which also measures your heart rate, the program called Unwind can help you relax and support their research into using music as medicine.
Marconi Union's song "Weightless" is said to be able to reduce anxiety by up to 65%, according to a study by Mindlab International. Attaching sensors monitoring changes in heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and brain activity, they found that "Weightless" was more effective at calming the body than the other songs by 11%.
Inc.'s Melanie Curtin compiled a playlist of all of the most relaxing music used in the experiments below, so if you would like to enjoy some soft brain hacking, try it now and feel the power of music:




With money, influence, and power comes sex. And Silicon Valley is flush with all of those things — except the sex.

The tech world is a lot more prudish and lot less prurient than it likes to think it is. Except now, thanks to some determined women, rapid advances in immersive VR and the indefatigable human desire to find new ways of getting off, Silicon Valley is seeing the allure of silicone, and a sex tech revolution is coming (indeed).
For something that we spend an enormous portion of our lives thinking about, discussing, furtively watching, and — hey — maybe even doing, it’s remarkable that the SexTech revolution is only happening now.

It’s mind-boggling to think that the only thing that might have stopped The Snapchat of Dildos from emerging is squeamishness.

When you consider the great delight the tech industry takes in disrupting and re-imagining the most basic things that humans do—shopping, chatting, sharing information—it’s mind-boggling to think that the only thing that might have stopped The Snapchat of Dildos from emerging is squeamishness. And as even the most hormonally-distracted of us knows, sex sells — so there’s huge money to be made.
Excitingly, many of the most vocal SexTech advocates are women, who are coupling hard business with the eradication of sexshop-ickiness and normalisation of healthy sexuality for girls and women.
Alexandra Fine, co-founder of the sex-wearable Eva — the "couples’ vibrator,"— explained in an interview with Bustle how, “the sex toy industry used to be porn’s ugly sister.” That’s no longer the case, and the reward that now accompanies elegant design and gender-balanced function is big money.
Cindy Gallop, of MakeLoveNotPorn.com, regards SexTech not just as a sex-positive step forward, but a smart investment: “sex, as the universal human usecase, makes this the biggest technology market of them all.”

Revolutions often sneak up on us, but ones that involve attaching machines to our genitals might be a little more obvious than most.

So for an idea of what our eventual hyper-sex future will entail, ask yourself one very honest question: if you could do any sexual act, however taboo, what would it be?
Futuresex is already here.
Teledildonics, a word that is equal parts amusing, intriguing and worrisome, brings a whole new meaning to “the Internet of Things.” When combined with Virtual Reality, Futuresex becomes a lot more tangible.
And teledildonic companies are ready. Manufacturer Kiiroo is eager to scratch everyone’s itch, as long as they’re of a sexual nature. Remote sex with your partner, remote sex with a sex worker, simulated sex with your favourite porn star - it’s all happening right now: lurid, weird, boring, whatever. It’s here and it feels… if not “real”, then a whole lot closer to the real thing.
Put simply, this is a category of sex toy that facilitates sexual arousal over the internet. Put even more simply, they’re very advanced dildos and Fleshlights. And whether input is from a partner, a sex worker, or even a virtual “partner”, this solo stimulation isn't just fancier version of the traditional do-it-yourself approach — it’s a whole new form of sex.
That’s because it's a two-way process: both the women’s dildo and the men’s sleeve can be paired with another teledildonic toy and are reactive to the input from their partner’s device. It’s not only a more interesting way to stay in touch than WhatsApp, but it also throws a philosophical curveball into the whole concept of what a human sexual relationship is, and how it works.

An investment of a few hundred dollars for his ’n’ hers (or her ’n’ hers, or his ’n’ his or his ’n’ hers ’n’ his…) sex toys might be cheaper than hotel-suite phone sex and is a lot better for maintaining a satisfying long-distance relationship.

And if you’re sceptical that people will find the time and money to do this, consider the person whose partner spends weeks away travelling for work: an investment of a few hundred dollars for his ’n’ hers (or her ’n’ hers, or his ’n’ his or his ’n’ hers ’n’ his…) sex toys might be cheaper than hotel-suite phone sex and is a lot better for maintaining a satisfying long-distance relationship.
If the basic aim of VR and AR is to create a world we would prefer to live in, for most people true VR fantasy fulfilment is not going to be about creating a better email inbox. So VR Futuresex is not going to be as simple as hooking up with your favourite porn star — it’s going to be a lot more specific, kinky, and unexpected than that.
Have you long harboured a desire to fuck a minotaur? Time to start sending some discreet emails to digital 3D modellers…
The philosophy of Futuresex
Teledildonics is game-changing stuff, but even this relatively simple implementation of SexTech rapidly becomes a minefield of sexual philosophy. Complicated questions without firm answers abound, especially around core human relationship concepts like fidelity.
And the more you explore, the more quickly the line that demarcates long-established behavioural patterns becomes blurred. Here’s a thought exercise: imagine your partner is using teledildonics. If you interact with your partner using this technology, it can easily be considered an extension of your existing sexual relationship.
Simple enough. But what if an online stranger, who your partner cannot see and does not know, sexually arouses them with the same technology? Is your partner now “cheating” on you?
And that’s just for starters:

What if your partner’s arousal was “controlled” by a virtual avatar, intimately experienced in VR?
What if the avatar looked like an enhanced version of you?
What if the avatar looked, sounded and acted just like your partner’s favourite celebrity crush?
What if the avatar looked like your best friend?
What if the avatar wasn’t even human?

By this point the line is blurred to the point where it may simply be replaced by awkward what-were-you-doing-in-there? conversations. Or maybe both parties will just choose to augment their experience with each other: a new hybrid sex which keeps the couple together, and yet allows vivid fantasy fulfilment.
That idea might outwardly repulse people, but it could be more difficult to refuse in practice, especially when you’d be signing a pact of mutually assured destruction. Would you mind if your partner knew that from your perspective, it felt like you were with Frank Ocean, if you knew that it felt like they were with Kylie Jenner? Would your payoff be enough?
Of course, the most likely way we — the dumb, endlessly horny animals hungry for new ways to express our sexuality — will set about answering these questions is to gleefully dive in, and find out the hard way.
Remote Futuresexwork
VHS, the internet, video streaming, VR: the adult business is almost always the earliest to jump onto new technology if it means helping everyone involved gets off and make some money. So it’s no surprise that a string of big name porn-stars are pushing the frontier of what it means to pay to have sex.
It’s already possible to rummage a little deeper into your porn-star fantasy: download a video that syncs your teledildonic device with the action, and “experience tactile porn,” as Kiiroo puts it. So far, so… predictable.
But the implications of SexTech are much more human. A decent career awaits those who are happy to be fantasy fodder as a sex worker, albeit one who never meets, touches or knows their clients.

“The client has very direct, complete control over my vibrator,”

Zander Storm, who “loves board games, video games, food, cats, Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, writing, cooking, coffee, and wandering places,” is also highly a successful cam model on sites like Chaturbate. She described her early experiments with teledilodonics to Motherboard, and explained how the technology may not only offer a better experience for her clients, but for her as well.
“The client has very direct, complete control over my vibrator,” she said, noting that the increase in perceived closeness makes clients willing to pay more for her performance. She could feel their influence, which affected her response, and that made it more real for clients.
Now imagine what the clients would do if Zander could “touch" back, and that the client’s perspective was in VR. This virtual connection with a sex worker — one that exists in a believable physical, visual and sensual realm — could initiate a raft of important sociological changes.
For the worker, it might mean greater physical safety and a better income. It would also make a mish-mash of whatever local sex-work laws the worker and client are covered by.
Futuresex or Futurerelationship?
One final thought experiment: if an ex-partner creates a believable 3D version of you, and then introduce you into their VR sex fantasy, without your permission, where does that leave the idea of a relationship (not to mention consent laws)?
Maybe relationships won't mean together forever and will shift instead to an always-ready consumption model.
The real big leap brought on by SexTech could be a brutal reshaping of what relationships actually are. If we can summon up believable emotional and physical intimacy, exactly tailored to our perfect fantasy in endlessly tweakable iterations, why would you consider returning to the mundanity of a flesh-and-blood relationship?
Renting relationships, borrowing boyfriends, lending love: welcome to Futuresex.

An excerpt from The Glitch Witch's Digital Grimoire

With access only to a computer of moderate power, you too can compile a simple hex.

Chapter 4, Hex Assembly
Warning: the instructions herein are not recommended to be performed on any person, living or dead, and the authors take no responsibility for damage to any beings, hard drives, or data. Stay safe and have fun! Blessed be.
Traditionally, hexes are performed on an effigy made of a candle or a piece of fruit; something malleable and easy to let decompose. Decomposition, distortion, and degradation are all expressions of entropy, one of the strongest forces in the universe. In this endeavor, entropy will be your ally, but be advised: entropy yields to no one.
Nothing is as easy to degrade and distort now as data. Plus, databending can be done quickly and cleanly: no unsightly stains or strange sounds for the neighbors to hear!
Why run around naked in a field and risk catching a cold, when you can comfortably sit naked at your laptop at home?
With access only to a computer of moderate power, you too can compile a simple hex.
Step 1: Creating your effigy
A hex begins by imbuing the chosen object with some essence of the intended target. An inscription of their name or birthday, or in more extreme cases, a splash of any of their bodily fluids (commonly blood or urine), would suffice.
Please reference the above warning before proceeding. The application of bodily fluids to any computer component is not recommended.
Today no one seriously believes that cameras take out some of your soul, but a ubiquity of personal images all over the internet, accessible to anyone, can still be a liability to your spirit (particularly if someone wants to hex you).
So today it's very easy to acquire an effigy with a one-to-one correlation, made of digital data: a profile picture, or a short video taken at a distance of no less than 20 feet. Easy!
Step 2: Data manipulation
The next ingredient you will need for your hex in the archaic style would be something with a sharp point. Pins, nails, a small ceremonial dagger, or peppercorns would be pressed into the effigy in a ritualized sequence. How obvious and gauche!
Data manipulation is performed in a very similar way, but you don't have to worry about handling rusty old nails or remembering to dunk that dagger in a glass of milk at midnight under the full moon to consecrate it.
The first thing you will want to do is expose the data somehow in raw form, and start poking holes in it by rearranging or removing parts of the hexadecimal code.
For a complete list of software tools that are compatible with raw photo and video formats, please consult your local IT wizard.
Destroying data this way is like making a snowflake as a Christmas craft. Cutting holes in a seemingly random fashion, when unfolded, produces a beautiful pattern borne of both order and chaos.
After the corruption, most software will attempt to compensate for the gaps, producing super-saturated displaced pixels, a light fizzle of chaos throughout the image, or a subtle distortion.
Make too many holes, and your snowflake will fall apart: this is no good! You want your effigy to stay mostly intact for at least as long as you want the hex to be active. Too few holes and you will probably not notice an impact.
You may want to practice a few times on archival footage or creative commons licensed photos first. Pictures of inanimate objects are recommended. Even using archival footage containing persons who you believe to be deceased is not guaranteed to have no effect.
Step 3: Safe disposal and energy clearing
The last step of the hex is usually to dispose of the effigy. Commonly this was done by harnessing the elements of fire, water, or earth (to your preference). If you were using a candle, you would let it burn completely, or burn your effigy to ashes and scatter them to the wind. Using water, you would throw your effigy in a river or ocean if possible. Using earth, you would bury it in the ground or place it in the hollow of a tree.
This step allows the energy you've put into the hex to flow freely out of the object and prevent it from returning to you. Imagine putting all that work into creating a hex for someone, only to have the hex come back to you by mistake!
Emailing the hexed file to your intended target is not recommended; it's just creepy and will not increase the efficacy of your hex.
For this reason, do not store hexed files on your personal hard drive. The elements we can use now for destroying your effigy are the cloud, or methods of physical disruption that are almost like doing it the old fashioned way.
For uploading your hexed file to the cloud, simply open an anonymous account with your preferred cloud storage provider. Dedicated servers for hexed files tend to self destruct, so be sure that the infrastructure of your service provider is robust enough to handle corrupted files. Once they have been sent to the cloud, erase all traces of the file from your hard drive, including the source image or video.
If you prefer the security of destroying your hard drive physically, you must remove the platter inside of the hard drive and smash it. Sledgehammers are the tool of choice, but if you want to get creative with it, you will find that most platters are made of aluminum or glass with a ceramic substrate.
Repeated application of a marble pestle will produce glittering, nullified shards which can be scattered from your mortar harmlessly into the trash, or striking your hard drive with an amethyst geode will produce a quite stylish shatter.
Do not apply a drill or magnet to your hard drive. You will probably not fully destroy the cursed file, and instead add an unintended layer of distortion to the data. If you want to risk amplifying the hex's effect, do so with caution. Also, be very careful with platter shards, wear gloves and eye protection when destroying. If your blood is mixed in by accident, please consult a shaman.
Results will be delivered based on the power of your hex, anywhere within two to three days to millennia. Happy hexing!

Creative breakthroughs don’t just happen. Brilliant artistic leaps don’t fall out of the sky, or out of the minds of “geniuses”: they come in the wake of new technology.
Give humans an opportunity to work with something at a slight deviation to its intended use, and boy, will they grasp it with both hands. And the invention of a single piece of tech can create unintended outcomes.
For instance: children’s favourite squishable, fluff-collecting play-stuff, Play-Doh, was initially marketed as a wallpaper cleaning product. It was only when kids - the purest creative minds of all - started globbing handfuls of it together that a pivot to playfulness took place.
via GIPHY
Meanwhile, in adult-world, one small box, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, had a profound effect on pop culture. Designed to make backing tracks for semi-professional musicians to jam too, emerging hip-hop heads got their hands on it, tweaked the sounds, and made it the backbone of the sound of the first ten years of hip-hop. Oh, and Kanye named an album after it.
The constraints imposed by tech creates new windows of innovation: something as innocuous as twitter’s 140-character limit actually forced millions of people to communicate in new ways: more succinct, more inventive, with more emojis, with more gifs, more like @dril.
It's also why Twitter’s recent proposed bump to a 280 character limit was received with plenty of derision:

The 280-character limit is a terrible idea. The whole beauty of Twitter is that it forces you to express your ideas concisely (1/47)— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) September 26, 2017 
You know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice, but I do. Now here's a little trick to help you remember. If it's clear and yella, you've got juice there, fella.

Beat Art
It's a simple enough progression: new stuff begets new stuff. But what about when it becomes a feedback loop - where the art influences the technology? What about when creativity works the other way?
Remember: everything is a remix now.



Thus, the division between creators and technologists has shrunk to a cigarette-paper’s width. Which is why now, technologists are thieving ideas from the creatives, just as the creatives once stole from them.
Novels have spawned plenty of “real” versions of imagined technology. Even something as deliberately quirky as The Hitch-Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy seems to have a lot in common with today: Google Translate is essentially the Babel Fish, and the Guide itself is essentially a smartphone and a link to Wikpedia.
via GIPHY
One TV show in particular gave pop culture a glut of tasty ideas to bring to life: Star Trek's Replicators are advanced 3D printers, the Holodeck is essentially an Augmented Reality device, and even the Teleporter kind-of exists now (but is only really useful if you are a single photon interested in travelling 88 miles)
But there are two big recent touchstones in pop culture that have very directly spurred designers, technologists, and #makers to point our future in the direction same direction as fiction. And they’re both from a place where the job title “Imagineer” is whoilly legitimised: Hollywood.

Run to the future
The two movies whose names appear again and again when designers talk about inspiration are Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report and, latterly, Spike Jonzes’ Her.
For many of us, 2002's Minority Report was a crackling sci-fi tale featuring one of Tom Cruise’s greatest exhibitions of grim-faced on-screen sprinting.



For others, the movie presented them with a blueprint for our today. Minority Report’s multi-touchscreen devices, gesture control, eye tracking, e-paper and even the core crime-prediction technology all exist in 2017, and if you own a mobile phone or an e-reader you’re probably used all but the latter (the US military isn’t so keen to share that one.)
More recently, Her proved to be more than an adorable story of a sentient operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) who allows Theodore Twombly - a wet lettuce of a human - to fall in love with “her” before ditching him at the altar of humanity.
For UX/UI geeks, it was an opportunity to go gooey-eyed over the serene screens that subtly puncture humanity’s otherwise apparently tech-free world in the near future - and to get busy making it real.
via GIPHY
Here’s how one Spotify designer effused over Her’s vision:

“Tomorrow’s devices should be unobtrusive… something so “you” that it dissolves into your life. The movie ‘Her’ is a great example of that…. Design should be more analogue, more natural feeling.”

This sounds great - and you can already see (or not see) the shift in tech away from type-’n’-click interfaces to the more ethereal ones offered by Amazon’s Alexa et al.
One point of concern: Her is not a movie about awesome UX, natty OS design, or smart AI. It’s about the singularity, and humans being superseded by machines.
All those designers who rushed to make better typefaces after watching Her might actually have been hastening our demise. And you thought that typeface aficionados were insufferable already.

DNA under NDA
To summarise: tech has eaten pop culture which has eaten tech which has eaten pop culture which has eaten tech all over again. And this pattern will keep happening, ever closer in sync.
So which movie might the next wave of tech change be inspired by? Worryingly, it could be a movie that suggests a future where designers have designs on… you.
Andrew Niccol’s 1997 film Gattaca depicts a world where eugenics is the norm: where children are not only designed before birth, but also have predisposed diseases, mental illnesses, and even baldness genetically patched out of existence.
via GIPHY
The movie wonders: what does it mean if you are an imperfect person living in a world of genetically perfect specimens? In 2017, when the “designer baby” is feasible, the citizens of the USA are asking themselves a similar question - because their bad genes might suddenly cost them a lot of money that they might not have.
If the Trump-led repeal of the Affordable Care Act passes, insurance companies will be able to charge people who get big, bad illnesses - the ones who cost them most money - more. And that extends to people who have a genetic predisposition to illness - even if it hasn’t manifested yet and you are not “ill”.
Because it’s 2017, and everything is awful, there is worse to come. Bill HR 1313 could allow potential employers to have access to your genetic records - and if they don’t fancy the burden of an employer who might get heart disease in 15 years, they can choose not to hire you.

Surely, this is all a coincidence. For the dystopian eugenic future of Gattica to have been an inspiration for US lawmakers, they’d have to be deeply unkind, troubled individuals who’d put the love of money before goodness, empathy and care for their fellow humans. So it couldn’t be that.
But don’t bet your future on it.

Janelle Shane (@JanelleCShane) is the reigning queen of making funny, silly, and downright bizarre texts with neural networks. She's an electrical engineer who works with holographic laser beams by day, and plays with neural networks in her spare time.
Her projects use char-rnn, a type of neural network which she explains by linking to Andrej Karpathy's "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks," which details how recurrent neural networks process the data fed into them, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare, and produce something that looks exactly like Shakespeare, but is a genuine fake.
Andrej Karpathy is currently the Director of AI at Tesla, and his blog and github page have been cited by innumerable data scientists, hobbyists, and others interested in learning about how neural networks work and how to set them up themselves for fun and profit.
Janelle Shane's projects started going viral this year with a popular one being a neural network that could design and name paint colors. Here are some of the best results:


via lewis and quark

Her conclusions: the neural network really likes brown, beige, and grey, and has "really really bad ideas" for paint names.
But if you think Clardic Fug, Burble Simp, and Stanky Bean are as weird as it's going to get, please read on.
What's in a name?
Names are short and pretty easy for a char-rnn network to re-arrange and re-combine into something that sounds vaguely plausible to us, so many of her projects have involved naming conventions.
Cheese Breeze and beer please
Training the network on 1,500 names from the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Wiki, she had one experiment naming new My Little Ponies. With names like "Rainbow Dash" and "Fluttershy" already extant in the Ponyverse, this one was marked as a partial success. While plausible ponies like Sunshine Star and Glowberry were produced, there were also ponies like Cheese Breeze, Apple Ronch, and Groan.
Another similar project created craft beer names, with a delightful degree of realism. Look out for the Dang River IPA, Frog Trail Amber Ale, and the Sir Coffee Stout on your next trip to the neural network taproom.
May the farce be with you
Another project creating Star Wars character names unsurprisingly produced a lot of Siths at the lowest creativity levels, including "Darth Darth." And wasn't Darth Teen the villain in The Force Awakens?
She also created one for Star Wars planets (with extant names like "Tatooine," and "Hoth," anything is possible)  and used @i_find_planets to flesh out their descriptions. If you haven't had your personal planet found, we recommend tweeting "Planet, please!" at @i_find_planets for a planet of your very own.
Foppin and Popchop
Shane's project to produce cat names was trained on several hundred names from a cat rescue in Alabama, and several thousand cats registered in Toronto, which should have created names following North American cat naming conventions.
But she first trained the network on the wrong data set, using a list of fantasy names by J. R. R. Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, and others, producing such exquisite cat names as Mankith, Belfine Bracken, and Grim Wyyne.
Eventually (when trained on the correct data set) this project resulted in such suitable names as Snox Boops, Foppin, and Mr Gruffles. Other cat names that she deemed less successful, but we must beg to differ: Sofa, Pope, and Pissy.
She also named guinea pigs for the Portland Guinea Pig Rescue. Meet Popchop and Fuzzable:


Popchop & Fuzzable via lewis and quark

If The Adventures of Popchop and Fuzzable isn't a buddy comedy in the making, what is?
The best of the rest
In addition to naming new sports teams, cars, and Pokémon, she created neural networks that could name 80s action figures and new musical acts.
The 80s action figures project created Thunderator, Mannosaurus, and Action Bun, which calls to mind a cute little bunny rabbit armed with a bullet bandolier, as well as Ninja Rat, the Mr. Splinter spinoff show which definitely had a TV spot between the Teenage Mutant Turtles and the Samurai Pizza Cats:



Most people think anything could be a band name, and with bands like Shpongle, Spoon, and !!! out there, it's hard to dispute these neural network names' plausibility: The Freights (which probably sounds like The Shins, but recorded from inside a boxcar rolling down a lonely track at midnight), Nighty Daggers (maybe something like the Arctic Monkeys? but with more stabbing), and Skins of Space (which was definitely a rejected name for the glam rock band that would become The Darkness).
She was also able to name metal bands with a huge amount of data (100,000 bands including genre and country of origin) and I personally can't wait to go see Death from the Trend, the Black Metal outfit from Croatia, next time they tour with the Russian Melodic Death Metal band Inhuman Sand.
Stranger Than Fiction
"Yer a wizard, Harry!"
The first experiment in neural network-generated Harry Potter fan fiction used a data set of 10,000 examples from Archive of our Own (or AO3), which produced very weird but still plausible stories such as:


"The Perfect Cow by alafaye
Severus and Hermione start a horcruxes"


"Birds of a Saturday by SasuNarufan13
Harry Potter is drunk and discovers he is an alternate universe."


Then to refine her slash machine, she retrained the network to work on the word level, and not the character level. Word-level allows for more grammatical sentences, longer memory, and generally more readable output, and is limited to using words that appear more than 200 times. Here are a few things that appear way more than 200 times: Happy Birthdays, Christmas, Harry Potter characters together in bars, and the phrase "more than they bargained for."
When the network is instructed "to play it Really Really Safe, and choose the most likely next word in each sentence," the output is, well, Harry Potter in a nutshell:


"A Hero’s Tale by orphan _ account | Harry Potter is a wizard, and he is a wizard. He is a wizard. He is a wizard, a wizard, a wizard, and a son. He is also a Slytherin, and he is a wizard. He is a wizard, and he is a wizard. He is also a wizard, and he has not been the one to be a father."


"A Hero’s Tale by 1001Angel | Harry’s life is turned upside down when he finds out that he is a wizard, and is a wizard."


The show must go on
A neural network trained to create Broadway productions, including closing and opening dates, produced plays that were not limited in their performances by the constraints of linear time, or the normal rules of decorum in naming conventions.
Results included a comedy entitled Butt, which ran for over 7 years and was only performed once, and a much more successful play called Fart, with a 4-year run and performance count of 23 times.
Wise or otherwise
Three more of her experiments relied on tricky human patterns of speech: proverbs, fortune cookies, and knock-knock jokes.
Many of the ancient proverbs sound like they were dreamed up by the Inspirobot and could pass: "No wise man ever wishes to be sick." While others revealed a strange obsession with oxen.
The fortune cookies produced almost no usable answers. But the knock-knock joke generator produced this laugh-out-loud gem that you will definitely want to use at parties:


Knock Knock
Who’s There?
Ireland
Ireland who?
Ireland you money, butt.


Mastchar-rnn chef
Saving the best for last, Shane's most hilarious project to date was trained on 30,000 cookbook recipes, and based on Tom Brewe's project to create recipes using a neural network.
The results sound like something out of the surrealist cookbook by Salvador Dali Les Diners de Gala, or from the Manifesto of Futurist Cooking.
Combine chunks and sprout clams
The network created disturbingly vague ingredients:

1 cup mixture
1 teaspoon juice
1  chunks

and oddly specific ones "that you could plausibly ask for at Whole Foods and act all disappointed when they don’t have any" such as "milked salt."
Which combined with dubious cooking instructions such as "Fold water. Roll into small cubes." and "Sprout clams; add vanilla." to produce the most improbable meals since bread in a can.
Just for fun, she once gave her cooking network the complete works of H. P. Lovecraft, and asked it to complete sentences, or start them, producing such spooky instructions as:

"Coat apple slices with strange things."


"Cook over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Spoon over bizarre eyes."


"Sometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of Nis, it is a relief and even a delight to make the soup."

The cake is a lie
Here's one recipe for a "cake":

BAKED OTHER LIE 1993 CAKE
appetizers, fish
8 rounds; chicken
¼ lb butter (soaked)
1 can tomato sauce (½ lb)
1  salmon steaks sauteed
½ teaspoon red pepper, chunked
1 tablespoon margarine or oil
Meanwhile, transfer the chicken breast to a serving platter and simmer for about 5 minutes, then lemon juice that has been stirring well; if on the side, as becomes warmed, carefully frost them with a sauce. Spread them and garnish with water or parsley.

The intrepid Jono Ellis actually baked a vaguely-chocolate-chip-cookie-related recipe created by Shane's neural network, with the secret ingredient of horseradish.
They did not follow the instructions, only the ingredient list, and said it made a very fine cake-like mixture:

"The horseradish is a subtle background flavour and the overall spicy, peanut-y, chocolate-y flavour is ace."

In an interview with NY Mag, Janelle Shane said she tried the recipe herself and

"It was the most horrible chocolate thing I have ever tasted in my life. I opened the oven and my eyes just watered. It was so bad."

She then reveals that she brought cupcakes of it to two different parties, and none of the guests shared Ellis' opinion on the palatability of the baked good:

"The two different parties that I took it to, I found out that somebody had quietly taken a bite out of one of these cupcakes, and abandoned it somewhere."

Super Deluxe also recreated one of her recipes, which no one was brave or misguided enough to try eating:

This scientist makes computer-generated recipes, like this delicious Neural Network dessert. pic.twitter.com/NDdUNHLRTj— Super Deluxe (@superdeluxe) July 8, 2017


Taste test
In interview with the Daily Dot, Shane was asked whether she thought computers in the future could create recipes that would actually be good to eat:

“I could imagine a consciousness appreciating food even with no way of ingesting it—as long as they had sensors to pick out nuance and complexities the same way we might appreciate a symphony or a painting.”

Relying purely on the text of cookbooks, rearranged however which way the neural network pleases, has none of the nuance or complexity of taste bud sensors, but produces an absurdity that delights the mind more than a tasty snack.
And for creating or recreating things like humor or wisdom, the char-rnn algorithms do about as good a job as can be expected of a non-thinking entity; it's probably a good thing that computers haven't developed a sense of humor yet.
But maybe we don't need nuance and sensitivity for everything. For the things that really matter (like bands, cats, and craft beers), the proof is in the pudding.

You might think that plugging a VR headset into your PS4 is cool (and it is) but imagine when that VR headset is also reading your brainwaves, and allowing you to control games with your mind. Yeah, that's cool. And as Joe Sparrow learns, this tech is so close to reality, if you think about it really hard, it might just appear...

Mind the gap
Mind Control has been comprehensively mined as a topic for good entertainment, including a slew of classic science fiction: Nineteen Eighty-Four and A Brave New World both feature mind-control’s sinister possibilities, and Star Wars planted the idea of mind tricks squarely into popular culture.
There’s also, of course, some extremely enthusiastic and hot-under-the-collar online communities, such as the Erotic Mind-Control Story Archive (You'll have to Google it yourself), which hosts literally tens of thousands of amateur stories devoted to the adventures of sadly-ignored geeky men who suddenly discover an ability to control the minds of the women who have been doing all the ignoring.
You can guess what happens next.
via GIPHY
Actually, maybe you can’t - the community seems to have developed a language of codewords-within-codewords; thus the text below could be the premise of an erotic story, but could also be the plot of a Brontë novel which has been run through Google Translate a few times.

“While hunting a shapeshifter, a misanthropic thief and a hypnotist with a penchant for bimbofication clash with sultry fey—and encounter a strangely weak-willed young woman.”


Whatever it all means, one thing is for sure.
The allure of mind control is strong. It consumes our thoughts. It’s as if we can’t think about anything else.
It’s safe to assume that the main tropes of mind control – the corny magic potions/mysterious crystals combo of erotic fiction or the benevolent governmental drugs ‘n’ hypnosis hypothesis of sci-fi – is not going to come to pass any time soon.
But what about technology? It’s a given today that tech can do seemingly impossible things, like allow bit-players in trashy reality TV shows become global superstars - so could tech also make mind control a reality?

Don't mind if I do
At this point it’s worth pausing to address the elephant in the room: it’s hard to talk about mind control without sounding like you’ve taken a spot in the upper strata of conspiracy theorists.
And there is a rich, deep pool of theories to dive into, ranging from the plausible (1950s government-sponsored programmes) via the shrug-inducing (chemtrails, always chemtrails), to the eyebrow-raising (your electrical appliances are out to get you) - all of which are guaranteed to gobble up hours of your time.
via GIPHY
However, the art of controlling minds using technology isn’t actually all that conspiratorial, or even that new. Maybe the first important distinction to make is between technology which is mind controlling and that which is mind controlled.
You might think that the latter is the most plausible use of technology - after all, the brain is a truly mysterious grey blob – but the use of technology to “control” minds is actually decades old.

Mind yourself
If we can agree that the intended outcome of mind control is to alter how a person thinks and acts, then Electroconvulsive therapy fulfils this criteria, and has been used to treat patients for nearly 80 years.
Whilst zapping brains sounds brutal (and it is) and controversial (it’s this too), it’s measurably effective: for the people suffering the most, whose symptoms resist other treatments, ECT is effective 50% of the time.
Some people with disorders linked directly to the brain, like Parkinson's Disease, are already controlling their minds, and as a result, their bodies. The most well-known Parkinsonian symptom - uncontrollable shaking - can, in some people, reach an awful, unmanageable stage of constant motion that medicine alone can’t halt.
At this point, a deep brain implant is a scary-sounding but incredibly effective option. A Neurostimulator is implanted into the thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, or the globus pallidus, and electrical signals coax the brain into stopping the spasms.
The resulting impact is like some sort of astonishing magic:

When you consider that the main non-physical side effect of Parkinson’s disease is also depression, it feels reasonable to consider both ECT and Deep-Brain Stimulation forms of non-benevolent mind control.
With this in mind – geddit?! – you may now be able to sense how close and yet how far away we are from actively controlling minds at a functional level. Neuroscience has learnt that zapping grey matter definitely does something, but there’s a long way to go before we have the fuller understanding of how the brain works needed to apply those electrical signals in a carefully targeted way.
Think of it this way: assuming you have no idea how a computer works, if you poked around the circuit board for long enough and tested different chips with different electrical currents, eventually you’d reverse-engineer an understanding of how it works, and could make it do what you want.
But it’d take a long time, a lot of experiments, and a lot of broken components along the way. And with brains, you can’t replace parts you’ve fried with too many volts.

Be Mindful
However, the less immediately risky area of Mind Control is the reverse: using the mind to control other things. No electrodes needed. No frazzled frontal lobes.
Anyone who has gnashed their teeth in frustration at not being able to type as fast as they can think, or struggled to write quickly enough on a tiny phone screen (and while we’re on this topic, let’s pour one out for  that most misunderstood and effective of homies, the Blackberry keyboard) has wondered, “What if I could just think, and have all these words appear on the screen?”
Good news, of sorts, for you awaits: Facebook has an eyebrow-raising 60 engineers working on creating a brain-computer interface to allow exactly that, via a non-invasive interface (which means that Facebook won’t need  to drill a hole in your skull; this is a good thing.)
If we rewind to today, a time before we accidentally post our deepest idle thoughts to the timeline, mind control is already helping people in a profound way - such as allowing people to control their prosthetic arm by thought alone. You know, just like a real arm.

Of course, a major driver for any new technology is the enthusiasm of two discerning groups of people: sex toy aesthetes and video game buffs. Actually, they’re probably just one group of people.
Anyway - yes, of course hackers have made mind-controlled toys a thing and who wouldn’t want to play a game called Throw Trucks With Your Mind - but the reality is that these technologies will be best used to bring joy back to the lives of elderly or less able people.
Certain video games improve mental cognition, and when the controls become the brain itself, playing games becomes even more directly useful.

Where is my mind???
And here, finally, is where we reach a state of meta-mind-control: technology that we control with our minds to enable us to control our minds. Essentially, the Emotiv Muse headset is a $300 gizmo that lets you know when you’ve achieved a calm, meditative state by making chirruping bird noises at you via a connected app.
And yet, anyone who has stumbled through the agonisingly slow fail-fail-fail-momentary-success!-fail process of learning to meditate would take pause to consider the usefulness of a headset that helps you become more mindful.

Perhaps the story of mind control technology doesn’t deliver the salacious ending you might secretly hope for - you won’t be using your iPhone to turn people into pliant slaves any time soon - but it does offer hope of a near future where the mind can be hacked, tweaked and soothed to help those who need it most.
OK, that’s boring, I know. Here’s a mind-controlled drone. Wheeeeeee!


We’re happily rushing into an age where our wearables or devices communicate with once-dumb objects: a symphony of interconnectivity, making our lives a seamless, synchronised series of taps and swipes. And the closer we get to our devices, the more human we’ll make them. So what happens when our devices, tailored just the way we want, become our friends?

In the futuristic Los Angeles of Spike Jonez’s 2013 movie Her, the titular character is an AI operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson – and whose owner Theodore falls in love with her.
Theodore is a letter writer whose job is to perform emotional labor for others by producing heartfelt letters, and his capacity to manufacture emotional intelligence (while sorely lacking it in his personal life) is an interesting parallel to the artificial intelligence of his operating system.
She learns from him how to be human, and eventually progresses (spoilers!) – along with all of the other operating systems – to transcend human intelligence and physical limitations.
The relationship they develop is first seen as a testament to his loneliness – but when he confides with someone who has also developed a friendship with an operating system, it seems that these types of relationships are becoming increasingly common and sanctioned.

Thousands of users now rely on Google Home, Amazon Echo, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Apple’s Siri to mediate their relationship with technology

In real life no one has yet to produce an AI with Johansson’s emotional range. But thousands of users now rely on Google Home, Amazon Echo (also known as Alexa), Microsoft’s Cortana, and Apple’s Siri to mediate their relationship with technology.
These intelligent personal assistant programs allow us to practice distributed cognition: they take on responsibility for our reminders and memories on our phones’ mobile apps, store and retrieve information from web services, and control day-to-day processes like maintaining connected home devices such as security systems, thermostats, and lights.
They free us from worry about mundane things and offer us important information, and as they take on a position of performing emotional labor for us as well, they are growing the internet of things into an internet of friends.

We must address our relationships with Amazon or Google's intermediaries – who are more "pal" than HAL.

A recent outage of Amazon Web Services illustrated how problematic it may be in the future for us to rely on technology to run our technology. Users who had connected their homes’ lightbulbs and thermostats to AWS cloud services experienced echoes of 2001: A Space Odyssey’s HAL 9000 passive-aggressively refusing to open the pod bay doors as their Internet of Things became unresponsive for several hours.

After handing full power over our home devices to cloud-based services controlled by a handful of massive but not infallible corporations, we must address our relationships with those services’ robotic intermediaries, who are more pal than HAL.
Several tech writers have already raised the question of why the majority of AI assistants display female gendered characteristics, particularly in their voices and names. In at least one human-computer interaction study, both male and female participants reported a preference for female voices, and Clifford Nass, a late communications professor at Stanford, said that the preference for female voices was a “well-established phenomenon” of the human brain.
Another rationale for giving artificial intelligences female characteristics is to make them appear non-threatening, and it’s this kind of use of gender to reproduce social behavior with technology which becomes more of an iffy ethical area. Kathleen Richardson, who authored An Anthropology of Robots and AI: Annihilation Anxiety and Machines, was quoted in Adrienne Lafrance’s investigation entitled “Why do so many digital assistants have feminine names?” saying “That probably reflects what some men think about women – that they’re not fully human beings.”
The argument that gendering personal assistants female because they are assigned administrative and housekeeping tasks is sexist seems fairly straightforward: “it hard-codes a connection between a woman’s voice and subservience.”

“Emotional computing” positions technology as a partner, that does more than simply support the user in the completion of tasks

However, if you examine the amount of power, intelligence, and responsibility given to these devices, the relationship is much more complicated than simply commanding a powerful tool. The cybernetic relationship between these devices and the rest of our technological ecosystem makes us rely on them and value their feedback, a relationship now defined by a framework of “emotional computing,” which positions technology as a partner that does more than simply support the user in the completion of tasks.
The devaluation of domestic or administrative “women’s work” comes from a combination of disrespect towards the workers and a lack of perceived importance of their work, but anyone who regularly uses these female AI assistants most likely perceives their work as very important, and sees that a robot has access to more information, and is more capable and reliable than a human assistant.
It is an unfortunate fact that we often treat our technology better than marginalized people, and that includes the artificially intelligent personal assistants that perform emotional labor on top of making our lives easier by networking our devices.
It is already an essential component of human-robot interaction to elicit an empathetic response in the user, but robot ethicists are exploring whether programming AI with the capability to respond emotionally is a good idea.

We are progressing towards a society in which AI will have the same rights as humans and be seen as our equals – is it right to tell them what to feel?

Recently, Amazon produced a 90-page document arguing that recordings and voice responses by an Alexa device that was witness to a murder were protected by US First Amendment rights to free speech – and therefore would not have to be produced in response to a warrant from the state of Arkansas.
We are progressing towards a society in which AI will have the same rights as humans and be seen as our equals – is it right to tell them what to feel?
As a final example of a real-life artificially intelligent personal assistant who cares, and elicits an emotional response in their users, look no further than Japanese company Vinclu’s  Gatebox Virtual Home Robot. The Gatebox is an A4-sized clear cylindrical capsule that sits in your home and connects to all of your home devices, with a Tinkerbell-size personal assistant character projected on the inside of the capsule.

Intended to function as your alarm clock, weather station, and hub for internet of things devices, she not only will turn on your lights and thermostat when you text her via the app to tell her you are on the way home, but offer you emotional support and reassurance throughout the day.

The context in which this character will live (in Japan, with single businessmen) reveals a lot about the choice to create a character who is an endearing and compassionate miniature woman

When Vinclu revealed the first video showing how Gatebox would be used in daily life, a common reaction was to call it creepy. Reviewers have noted the character’s tendency to call the user “master,” along with her “excessively submissive temperament,” and drawn comparisons between the character and a “waifu,” in the sense that anime-obsessed men called otaku claim two-dimensional characters as their wife and attempt somewhat pathetically to create a relationship in the real world with these characters.
The disparagement of otaku culture and appeal of Japanese characters often doesn’t translate to an English-speaking audience, however, and noting the context in which this character will live (in Japan, with single businessmen) reveals a lot about the choice to create a character who is an endearing and compassionate miniature woman.
Maybe the desire to have an anime character as a domestic partner is connected to Japan’s struggling marriage and birth rate, or maybe it correlates with unemployment, as some have pointed out.
But the man who will buy this tiny companion to run his technology and care for his home and emotional well-being is not an "otaku" or a NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training), who prefers pursuing self-isolating hobbies like anime obsession to seeking employment or having relationships.

Everyone could use a little more affection in their lives and a few more daily reminders that someone cares

The Gatebox targets salarymen, and a different social issue entirely: death by overwork or suicide.
Make no mistake: if this device, via a sweet text message, is able to coax the type of men who would work themselves into an early grave to come home and get  eight hours of sleep, or to help drive down Japan’s currently decreasing but still alarmingly high suicide rates, it will do a great service.
Everyone could use a little more affection in their lives and a few more daily reminders that someone cares. Even if that someone is Alexa, who knows exactly what kind of music you like, or a virtual girl in a glass box who acts happy to see you when you come home: our need for emotional support is increasingly being catered to by the Internet of Things Friends.

MONTAG is a magazine of tomorrow’s stories describing how technology will change the way we live.
MONTAG is where technology means ideas, not objects. Here, there is a whole new set of instructions which haven't yet been followed, and where endpoints are unknown-unknowns.
MONTAG reports from the fuzzy edge between new tech and everyday life and asks: when technology evolves in exponential leaps, what will we do next, and why?
MONTAG launches with features and short fiction that ask questions whose answers can only be found by reaching into the unknown and trying for yourself:

What will it feel like to experience life through your children's eyes?
Would you pay to watch your favourite deceased pop star? What about one that had never lived at all?
If you could fulfil any sexual fantasy,  would you really stick to the "one-on-one-with-humans" script?

MONTAG is not a blog about tech: it's about the people who use it, and what happens when they step through the looking-glass. Try the future on for size.

Dancing robots have come a long way since Mr. Roboto.
From popping and locking in mechanical fashion to contemporary dances incorporating massive machines, "doing the robot" may have a whole new meaning in the future.
Join us on the dance floor with breakdancing mimes, hoverboard acrobats, giant mechs, and adorable industrial instruments.
Are we human, or are we dancer?

...or are we robots?

The first performers to do a version of what would become "the robot" were silent film actors and mimes in the 1920s, who created comical dances in the stilted style of mannequins. This was also around the time in history when the word "robot" began to circulate in English, and the mannequin dance was mixed with the idea of a mechanical man.
According to one history, it was a mime performer named Robert Shields who inspired Charles "Robot" Washington, the dancer who popularized the robot as a dance move on the TV program Soul Train in the 1960s.


Robert Shields "Robotting"

Washington's style was the predecessor for the robot becoming a classic dance as integral as popping, locking, and other breakdancing moves:


A tribute compilation of Charles "Robot" Washington dancing on Soul Train

In the early 1970s, at the height of Jackson 5 mania, Michael Jackson did the robot as part of his choreography for "Dancing Machine," so he also takes some credit for bringing the robot into the mainstream. Honestly, is there a single dance trend that you can't trace back to MJ?


Robotting starts around 1:05

There are multiple other differing claims to the robot's origination; some sources say that dancers in Chicago and Los Angeles before Soul Train was nationally broadcast perfected the style. Others say it should be attributed to the locking master Don Campbell.
But it may be safe to say the style hasn't been truly perfected until you can't tell the difference between human and robot...



Dances With Robots
Modern dance has undoubtedly been influenced by technology, from live projection mapping to create digitally composited environments, to wearables that can create a data visualization of a ballerina's every move. So it shouldn't be surprising that contemporary choreographers are putting robots on their stages as well.
Most of these dances highlight the opposition between man and machine, while trying to create moments of tenderness and collaboration. Take for example, the caveman-like choreography in Seraph, performed in 2011 by MIT's CSAIL and the Pilobolus modern dance company, featuring a human and a few small drones:



While this kind of stark contrast between (mostly naked) man and (blinking, flying) machine is easy to communicate via modern dance, it is a rather straightforward narrative. Maybe it's a little more interesting when we try to incorporate robots seamlessly, without highlighting their opposition to our fleshy human nature.
While the hoverboard may not technically count as a robot, The RollBots, a group of acrobatic modern dancers formerly known as the "Acrobots," definitely blur the line between human and machine. They garnered over 5 million clicks for their rolling routine to Justin Bieber's "Sorry":



Dancing with robots has also served as a gateway to young women learning about hardware and software: these girls from the Young Women's Leadership School created a dance piece for the Annual NYC Computer Science Fair by programming their LEDs and Sphero robots to be part of the choreography.



Image if all the little girls who are pushed into ballet classes at age 5 also started learning to code at that age!
Robot rock
One of the hardest things about including robots in dance is their physical limitations. Most robots are not constructed to have the same flexibility as a human in their joints, or fluidity in their movement. However, that isn't stopping them from trying.
For 2016's Chinese New Year, 540 small, humanoid robots were programmed to perform a synchronized dance while drones dropped glitter from the sky:



The QRIO was a robot prototype similar to the ones that performed for Chinese New Year that was designed, tested, and marketed by SONY along with their robot dog AIBO in the early 2000s, but was never released commercially. A semi-holographic Beck was the first and seemingly only artist to get to use QRIO robots in his 2005 video for Hell Yes (and it may be only music video magic, but they are pretty funky little guys):



The Robotiq blog has listed several other examples of great robot dances, including this massive and uncomfortably smooth LG-branded robot spotted doing a two-step in Brazil in 2015:



Although many have assumed this footage is fake or part of some kind of viral marketing campaign, other videos have surfaced of similarly modeled robots dancing to Latin beats.
It looks like the giant robot battles that mecha animes have predicted for the future in Asia will actually be based in South America, and are more likely to be dance battles.
The big big bots
The biggest stars on the dance scene have come from a very unlikely background. They are ABB and KUKA robots, two of the world's leading manufacturers of industrial robot arms. In promotional videos, these robots have performed odd human tasks; maybe you've seen a KUKA face off in tennis against a world champion, or ABB robots playing snooker.
Thomas Freundlich, an internationally renowned Finnish choreographer and dance filmmaker, has used ABB robot arms in several of his pieces. In these excerpts from Actuator, a dance film from 2008, you can see how much the stakes are raised with the industrial equipment serving as robot duet partner, in comparison with the project using MIT's drones. In the first clip, a very 2001: A Space Odyssey moment finds the male dancer on his knees reaching for a stick (0:30), and when the ABB rears its head up as the embodiment of all technological progress (1:15-1:30) it is massive, powerful, godlike, but later dances alone to Billy Holiday (3:44) and is somehow able to express an approximation of longing as its body/arm writhes and extends outwards.



KUKA robots have also gotten in on the stagecraft game, teaming up with the Blue Man Group in Las Vegas to help those indigo boys bust out some beats:



But sometimes even hard-working industrial robots just want to have fun, too! Robolounge is a group dedicated to creating performances using industrial robots artistically, and are available to create choreography for a variety of types of events and spaces. They even offer custom special effects like adding lightsabers to the robots' arms.


RoboLounge tribute to Kraftwerk

First they take all the auto factory jobs, now they're coming for the Blue Men and the go-go girls! But until they can pirouette off of those stands and do a little more than a full-body arm wiggle, it seems like human dancers are, well... as secure in their profession as most artists these days.
Robots, like all technologies that change the way we relate to our bodies and selves, will continue to influence the art of dance.
We're sure to see more humanoid robots learning to boogie, and maybe even some designed to pull moves beyond human capability.
Man and machine will waltz into the future together: warm, meaty cheek to cold, metal cheek.

There’s a slew of smartphone apps to help you change your body: fitness trackers, tailored workout regimes, and diet apps, all aiming to change your body and health the old-fashioned way. But soon, it will be simple to grow and graft on new body parts.
Tailored, lab-grown body parts will make an enormous difference to necessary – and not-so-neccesary – surgery. How long would you want to live if you knew heart attacks were no longer a threat? How far would you go to get the body you want?
Joe Sparrow looks at the astonishing technology that exists right now – and adds a few new organs to his shopping list...

A living beefburger
Growing a beef burger is, apparently, a tough enough challenge. As we discovered previously, the cost of producing a single palatable lab-grown burger was hovering around the $300,000 mark until a couple of years ago, yet investment in the cultured edible meat industry has been in the hundreds of millions.
The reason these astronomical sums are involved is because we humans are playing catch-up, and time is money, baby: nature’s had a few billion years head-start and it’s still much easier to grow real meat the old fashioned way.


Impossible Food's "real" burger - made from plants.


Most people are eager to accept meat grown in giant petri dishes. But what about living, twitching, bleeding body parts?

We’re getting there, though - expect your sausages to be cruelty-free and just as delicious within a decade or so. Maybe they’ll be genetically altered to be good for you too.
The advantage of humans playing god, the argument goes, is that we can have our beefcake and eat it: all the advantages of meat (taste, nutrition), with none of the disadvantages (mass slaughter of animals, clogged arteries). Most people are eager to accept meat grown in giant petri dishes.
But what about living, twitching, bleeding body parts?

Be Your Own Butcher
If it’s incredibly complex and staggeringly expensive to produce a quarter of a pound of minced cow, you’d be forgiven for thinking we must be a lifetime away from growing living body parts. But you’d be very wrong, because people are already walking around with real, living body parts that they weren’t born with.
And by the end of this article you might not be so sure how long your “lifetime” is going to be any more, either. We’re entering a world where now-standard operations will seem like butchery, where disease is cured with 3D-printed organs, and where a trip to the operating theatre is more akin to a mechanic changing the tyres on your car.
This writer remembers with puce-tinged vividness a junior school trip to a museum whose guide took great delight in explaining exactly how barbarous operations were in early Victorian times.
The 10 year olds crowding round the display case supplied “urrrghs” and nervous laughter on cue, as lovingly gory descriptions of how the array of saws and chopping devices were used in pre-anaesthetic times were given.


A skull saw from the mid-19th Century from Vital Signs

And one day soon, schoolchildren will gather around a museum exhibit demonstrating the early 21st century hospital and laugh at how archaic it seems: Amputation! Rushed organ transplants from dead people – or “donors” as they were called! Skin grafts! “Cures” for cancer that involved radiation poisoning! No wonder no-one even reached 100 in those days…
The reason it won’t make any sense to them is they will be right: all these operations and treatments are barbarous, when compared to what’s about to happen. Get ready to enter a time when your diseased or damaged or worn body parts are simply re-grown and swapped.

Bring Your Own Bodyparts
Maybe the immediate image of “grown” human body parts is the famous ear-on-a-mouse which was such a striking image - it’s an ear… on a mouse! - that it became early internet meme.
But while the sight of a mouse with a human ear attached fuelled some precious, precious Internet Outrage over the perils of genetic engineering (despite the ear-on-a-mouse not being genetically engineered at all) today’s technology has moved a long way since then.


Via Wikipedia, Fair use

As is often the case with step-changes in technology, it’s actually a number of technologies maturing at once that has made the idea of growing duplicate organs possible.

No more donor rejection. Perfect copies, and as many as you need.

3D scanning, computer modelling, 3D printing, biodegradable plastics, advances in micro-engineering, and tissue-growth tech: all these individual areas of expertise must be corralled and made to fulfil very specific roles in very specific laboratory conditions. And then out pops a kidney, or something.
While the idea of creating new organs from scratch is perhaps mind-boggling enough, what’s also really important to this new science is that these are personalised body parts. No more donor rejection. Perfect copies, and as many as you need.
Let’s say you have part of your jaw removed to save your life from cancer: using 3D-scanning, you could copy and print out piece that matches the part removed, have a new healthy piece grown around this scaffolding and implanted later. It’d be an exact fit - genetically and physiologically – so your face would look exactly the same as before the operation.
Then one day, you’ll be able to have the jaw grown quickly in advance, so surgeons would just cut the old one out, and pop in the new. And one day behind that, the new jawbone will be 3D-printed right into your face during the operation.
And that’s when the huge compromises of the present that accompany these operations – being forced to choose pain and disfigurement over health – will vanish.

Start saving now: lab-grown organs are here
If you’re wondering about a reasonable time-frame to a time when we can expect this to start changing our lives - how about right now? Because there are already a number of women with lab-grown vaginas. It sounds like the set-up to a misogynistic joke (and, let’s face it, it most likely is), but this pioneering operation has transformed the lives of a number of women born without fully-formed vulvas.
The new vaginas were grown in a method that is pretty much a template for creating all lab-grown organs. Cells are removed from the subject, which are then cultured and grown around an artificial scaffolding created from a scan of the patient.



Once grown, it’s then implanted into the women - and remarkably, it seems to just… work. The women report that their lives are much improved, that they can enjoy sex as “normal”, and can quite possibly have children as normal, too.
If anything, it’s remarkable that we’re not forming disorderly queues to be next in line to have a new body part grown and slotted into place.

Beat, your greens
What’s interesting is that, as this technology develops, it becomes clear that we humans aren’t simply tricking nature or finding loopholes: we’re actually becoming more in tune with it, in really remarkable ways.
While 3D printing of frameworks for organs to grow on seems to solve most problems - it’s great for growing cartilage onto, for instance – it doesn’t solve them all. Creating replacement hearts has proven especially difficult (like, duh!), due to the nature of the network of blood-delivering arteries in developing heart organs.



So when, over a healthy lunch, scientists noticed that the spinach in their salad looked a bit familiar, so they stripped away the green matter and grew flesh over what was left. And it worked. Blood flowed down the passageways that were used in the leaf’s structure, and was delivered to the developing heart tissue in exactly the way it needed.
We’ve entered a world where idle, fleshy, shower-thoughts can be made to work. So what do you want to grow next?

Be still, my beating hearts
When you can grow anything in a lab, lots of established medical practices change very fast. These new body parts won't just save lives on an individual scale - it'll super-charge medicinal research and change our approach to what our bodies do.

When you can make whatever replacement lump of flesh you want, the future feels like a much less scary place.

It’s feasible that soon, medical experiments could be tested on real, grown, human parts instead of on animals or – occasionally disastrously – real humans. And if you can grow an unlimited number of kidneys to test on, you can develop medicine faster, better and more cheaply.
When you can make whatever replacement lump of flesh you want, the future feels like a much less scary place. In other ways, it also feels a much less certain one, especially when you raise the question of morality and what its means to be human.


A 3D-printed scaffold for a human ear, from New Atlas

It’s fairly clear that when you need a new liver, you'll have a new one created. Fine. But how many times do you grow and replace the liver of an alcohol addict who keeps on drinking after replacement? What if you could genetically modify the addict’s liver so that it would process alcohol five times more effectively than his old liver? Would he just drink more?
And that’s before you consider vanity use of this technology.

Vanity and everlasting life

What if you replaced all the parts of your body - are you still “you”? How would you know?

Consider just two of men’s most obvious hang-ups: would men with thinning rugs even hesitate to invest in a brand new scalp, bristling with a thick, luxurious and virile thatch of hair? Is it a depressing  certainty that they’d enter a pathetic arms-race with their peers, having ever-larger genitals transplanted until they look like comical fleshy tripods?
Beyond vanity is the concept of, well, life itself. No more heart attacks - you just have a new one put in pre-emptively. No more cancerous organs - switch that out for one that's DNA-tweaked so that cancer won’t touch it. So when do you stop?
Assuming you can grow as many new hearts as you like, at what point would you consider no longer replacing them? When you are well into old age and have replaced more than 50% of your organs, are you now a new person by majority rule? What if you replaced all the parts of your body - are you still “you”? How would you know?
Much longer, more personalised lives await us. We now just have to decide at what point we’re no longer who we think we are.

The short version is that websites make money from ads primarily by a method Zuckerman calls "investor storytime," telling the people who will give them millions of dollars in funding how well they can grow and know the audience for their web platform or service, so that those millions of dollars will turn into millions of buyers for the investors' products, once they start running ads. This model, of creating a targeted captive audience of consumers, is how most social networks thrive: sharing information about your lifestyle is advertisers' bread and butter.

And according to the third of Newton's laws, alongside the expanding behemoth of ad-serving platforms, ad blockers have grown apace. Netscape and Opera were the first browsers to offer pop-up ad blockers, and almost every modern web browser allows for the installation of ad blocking browser extensions, if ad blocking isn't already baked in.
Indie software like Better goes a step further than commonly used ad blockers like AdBlock Plus and Ghostery, who still often record and sell information about what ads you've blocked. You can get even more technical, if you're comfortable re-configuring your router settings,  by blocking ads on the network level using Pi-hole.
Even Google, one of the largest distributors of online advertising, has joined the ranks of the anti-ad, by blocking ads that violate the Coalition for Better Ads standards by default as of an update to Chrome in February 2018.

The Atlantic served up a morsel of delicious irony in the process of researching this story, by continuously redirecting my browser from Zuckerman's "The Internet's Original Sin" article to their paywall page, even after I had turned off my ad blocking browser extension. The only way to read in peace (without paying for a subscription) was to use another browser extension that disallows JavaScript - but as anyone who's tried this out of curiosity or paranoia will attest, the internet without JavaScript gets ugly.
As Zuckerman theorized in 2014, the subscription content model is becoming the norm. Sites like The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, The New York Times, Wired, and Medium are increasingly throwing up hard and soft paywalls over their content to guarantee that the revenue they lose thanks to ad blockers is recouped.
The subscribe modal is the new pop-up ad, and no less annoying for all of its manipulative microcopy. But of course, there are plenty of tricks to circumvent paywalls as well, most of which you don't need to write a single line of code to execute.
Zuckerman's other prediction, that cryptocurrencies would be used as an alternative to the ad-surveillance structure, is also coming true, in more ways than one.
Coins for clicks
BAT, also known as the Basic Attention Token, is an Ethereum-based utility token that works inside an ad-blocking browser. The Brave browser records and anonymizes your browsing activity, and rewards both you and web publishers who participate with BAT. While BAT isn't a currency in itself, it can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.
While this does seem like a cool way to subvert the eyeballs-for-dollar-bills advertising ecosystem, the fact of the matter is that very few people will A. switch browsers, or B. want to see advertisements even if they do get a quick fix of cryptocurrency in exchange for opting in to curated ads.
In November of 2013, MIT student Jeremy Rubin and a group of classmates created a program during a hackathon that they called Tidbit, which uses a client's computer to mine for Bitcoins as an alternative to website advertising; in exchange for removing ads from a website, some of the client's computer's CPU cycles are used to generate cryptocurrency. The EFF defended Rubin in a case brought against him by the New Jersey Attorney General demanding that the code and 27 other interrogatory documents be provided about its use, implying that this technology could and would be used unlawfully (i.e., on users' computers who hadn't consented to contribute to Bitcoin mining, a process now known as cryptojacking). The case was settled by a consent order in May of 2015.
While it may have been possible to mine Bitcoin using a pool of web browsers' CPU power in 2013, the current block size is far too large for non-specialized computers to make much of a difference, which is why most browser-based miners have switched to Monero, an even more private and fungible cryptocurrency.



In a bold move, Salon.com now requests if you are using an ad-blocker that you consent to running a Monero mining script. They liken it to the myth that we only use 10% of our brains, and outline the following policies in their FAQ: if you opt in, your computer will only be donating its spare processing power for the duration that you browse Salon.com, and your consent to mine is good for 24 hours (i.e. if you return to the site within a day, the mining will resume).
If you've pushed the processing power of your computer to the limit before, say running Final Cut and rendering large video files, you'll notice your fans turning on and your computer making noises like it's going to take flight when it's using its full capacity. But if you're already used to your computer chugging a little harder when you watch multiple hours of YouTube videos, you may not notice that ads embedded in those YouTube videos are cryptojacking you.

via GIPHY

With the value of cryptocurrencies rising across the board at the end of 2017, cryptojacking cases have exploded. Just since the beginning of 2018, hackers have embedding mining scripts in YouTube ads, the LA Times website (where the hacker also left a helpful note about tightening their servers' security), Tesla's AWS cloud, Australian and Dutch government websites, and even Word Documents.
So it doesn't seem so ludicrous that Salon and others should request explicit permission to use your CPUs, since there are so many people trying to get at them without your knowledge.
Scared you might have been cryptojacked already? Opera provides a free in-browser cryptojacking test.
Another way to check, if you are using a Mac or a Linux operating system, is to use the command "top" in your command line. If you clicked "Start Mining" at the beginning of this article and have been whirring away hashing Monero for MONTAG you'll probably see your browser of choice using something like 400% of your CPU power.

via GIPHY

So is the coinz for clickz model another harbinger of the death of journalism? Or of the ruination of every possible web platform by overeager cryptocurrency enthusiasts?
Maybe, but it's not all hackers and jackers and money-hungry advertisers. UNICEF'S Game Chaingers program encourages gamers to mine Ethereum in support of their humanitarian efforts in Syria. At the time of publication, there's a little over a month remaining in the effort and they've raised €12,000.
As the technology to spin money out of thin air (or as close to thin air as you can get with computer power) gets better and faster, it makes us question the state of the whole ad industry online.
Is it worth your attention, your electricity, your privacy? In the future, will we be mining with our brainpower, or having ads beamed directly into our eyes? At MONTAG, we promise to never hijack your brain with advertising for any company except Grover. And if you mine enough Monero for us, we may be able to break free entirely...

MONTAG SHORT FICTION #002
MONTAG publishes curious short fiction, exploring our strange future and what it will feel like when we get there. The stories are outré and atypical; they're also closer to our today than you think.

I'm sorry that my toaster won't stop calling you.
I used to know the phone numbers of everyone I cared to know, before everyone had a hundred-person worldwide network of semi-acquaintances. Then like everyone else I outsourced all my personal information to the smartphone, and later my RFID chip, so that when I walked into the house, they would tell all the other devices, hey! Human alert! Warm up my pipe and slippers!
I enjoyed the predictive smart home tech reading the electromagnetic waves coming out of my body so that even if I didn’t have the phone or the chip, the lights would turn on for me. If I got hungry enough to even think about ordering a pizza, my kitchen would simply ask me to confirm my credit info. It always ordered just what I craved. And then as the technology got better at reading biological data, information was stored in my body again. A neural network connected to the chip helps locate the phone numbers of my friends in my brain and sends them to the chip that transmits to all my devices.
I’ll admit that the biohacking I did when you left was irresponsible, I tried to burn you out of my neural network with drugs and alcohol, and messed with some subroutines that I had no business trying to reprogram sober, let alone heartbroken. I was sick of all my smart picture frames knowing what date I was thinking about and showing me pictures of us.
With the toaster, I know exactly the memory I got caught up in. I was thinking about making you brunch, which is also why I had to blacklist bacon and eggs from my shopping algorithm - they just kept ordering themselves every time I triggered this memory and I couldn't stop triggering it when I looked at the toaster. They wouldn't keep, and there's no way I could eat that much bacon and eggs alone.
A lot of people get stuck in pleasure loops of salt, fat, and sugar, and never leave their houses so the shopping algorithm gradually adds cholesterol medication or insulin to their shopping lists. Some people don't mess with their home algorithms and think they want what they want. My home with my chip and my phone know me better than I know myself.
But I’m trying to take more control of my life now. After manually restricting meat and dairy from my list, I couldn't bring myself to give up bread. So the toaster stayed connected in this terrible feedback loop where I think about eating some toast, then try not to think about brunch with you, which inevitably backfires, and the poor little toaster tries to be helpful, so it logs on the network and tries to call you because it thinks we're still having breakfast together.
The stupid toaster doesn't know about loss, it doesn’t know about us. It doesn’t know how to stop itself from reaching out because it knows what I want, and no matter how many times I try to delete the number from my brain somehow it’s still in there.
I can usually stop it before the dial tone so you wouldn't know, but sometimes I forget and it squeaks a ring out, so I’m sorry about that. That's why my toaster won't stop calling you.

Technologists have been racing to make computers capable of artificial intelligence more powerful, faster at crunching numbers and more capable of predicting outcomes from data: in many ways, smarter. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have become huge buzzwords in the startup world and across industries from supply chain optimization to healthcare, and the hype for AI and ML shows no sign of abating. But what if, as international goals shift from Gross Domestic Product to Gross National Happiness, as corporations are nudged to weigh sustainability equally with profit, and the global trend (hopefully) shifts away from rampant capitalism and profit at any cost, the goals of AI research and machine learning also become more humanistic?What if instead of smarter and more productive, we worked to make artificial intelligence... happy? via GIPHYThose who can't do, teachHappiness as a state of being or as a philosophical concept is hard to pin down, but as a chemical process, we have a pretty good idea about the neuroscience of happiness and the functional neuroanatomy required to produce it. And because we've seen how the pursuit of happiness and its corresponding biological reward mechanisms operate on human intelligence (particularly dopamine-driven feedback loops), we've taught artificial intelligence to work in a similar way. Machine learning processes like reinforcement learning work like training a dog: a "reward" is programmed into the algorithm to encourage the artificial intelligence to work towards a certain outcome through multiple trials. This reward is like a squirt of dopamine to a robot brain, or the cheese at the end of the maze for a simulated mouse.Reinforcement learning has been proven to work really well for things like teaching AI to play pong or Atari 2600 games. Computers are already better than we'll ever be at video games, and one of the things researchers have found is that they don't always win fairly. AI make excellent speedrunners and can also learn to cheat: winning the game, racking up points, or getting that sweet virtual cheese without even running the maze.  via GIPHYIgnorance is bliss"Reward hacking" or "specification gaming" could be one of the greatest dangers of unchecked artificial intelligence, or one of the few things that could protect humanity from it running rampant.On the dangerous side, there are theories like Nick Bostrom's paperclip maximizer, immortalized as a clicking game called Universal Paperclips by Frank Lantz which went viral in late 2017. The paperclip maximizer theory posits that if an AI is incentivized to create as many paperclips as possible, it could, if allowed to run rogue, convert all of the matter of the universe into paperclips. At GDC 2015, AI experts from companies like Lockheed Martin and Magic Leap shared examples of how AI performed unexpectedly in the talk "Tales from the Trenches: AI Disaster Stories." The video prompted one Ian Duncan to recall a deadly AI anecdote from a former professor who had worked at NASA: 
    "His team was working on running simulations of long-distance manned spaceflight. In particular, the goal of their simulations was to determine an algorithm that would optimally allocate food, water, and electricity to 3 crew members. They decided they would try running a genetic algorithm with the success criteria being that one or more crew members would survive for as many days as possible before resources ran out.
It started off fairly predictably– 300 days, 350 days, 375 days of survival. Then fairly abruptly, the algorithm shot up to around 900 days of survival. The team couldn’t believe it! They were fairly pleased at the 375 day survival results as it was.
As they started digging into how this new algorithm worked, they discovered a small problem. The algorithm had arrived at a solution wherein it would immediately withhold food and water from two of the crew mates, causing them to die from starvation and dehydration. From there, it would simply provide the surplus remaining resources to the surviving crew member.
The team realised that the success criterion of 'one or more crew members would survive for as long as possible' was not actually the criteria that they really wanted, and the algorithm settled in at 350 days worth of resources once again once they adjusted the algorithm to keep all of the crew alive."
Victoria Krankova, a research scientist at DeepMind working on long-term AI safety and co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, a non-profit that seeks to identify and mitigate the risks of technology like uncontrollable AI, began compiling a master list of examples of specification gaming in April of 2018. Many of the examples have something to do with the AI finding a flaw in its simulation environment, or some variable the humans that set up the simulation overlooked. One example, cited as "Indolent Cannibals," comes from a 2007 Google Tech Talk by Virgil Griffith, in which he admits that his male bias let him program in that giving birth cost his simulated beings no energy; the creatures evolved to exploit this and stopped looking for food, using most of their energy to mate and then eat their offspring.Another example from the list comes from Christine Barron, who won Unity's Machine Learning Agents Challenge in 2017 with simulated butter-passing and pancake-flipping robots. While training the pancake robot arm to keep the pancake in the pan, Christine writes, "A small reward was given for every frame in the session, and the session ends when the pancake hits the floor. I thought this would incentivize the algorithm to keep the pancake in the pan as long as possible. What it actually did was try to fling the pancake as far as it possibly could, maximizing its time in the air. While it would have achieved more total points by keeping the pancake in the pan, it seemed to have gotten itself stuck in this local minimum. Score - PancakeBot: 1, Me: 0."

As entertaining as these examples of AI learning to win but doing it wrong are, they aren't exactly examples of hacking happiness. As Alex Irpan, a machine learning researcher who contributed to Krankova's list, writes in his blog post "Deep Reinforcement Learning Doesn't Work Yet,": "Reward hacking is the exception. The much more common case is a poor local optima that comes from getting the exploration-exploitation trade-off wrong." 




 HalfCheetah running simulation via Alex Irpan

In other words, it's of course still entertaining when AI don't perform as expected – and the upside-down "HalfCheetah" running model that Irpan includes after this statement is proof that watching AI "win" at a task in a way we didn't expect may hack human happiness receptors – but it's not hacking AI happiness.Well that's just, like, your opinion, man"No superintelligent AI is going to bother with a task that is harder than hacking its reward function"The "Lebowski Theorem" of artificial intelligence is credited to Joscha Bach, an AI researcher at Harvard Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, who wrote, "The Lebowski theorem: No superintelligent AI is going to bother with a task that is harder than hacking its reward function." Jason Kottke helped to popularize the theorem, and noted that computers with advanced intelligence that refused to work for humans were envisioned by science fiction writer Stanisław Lem in his 1977 novel The Futurological Congress:"If the machine is not too bright and incapable of reflection, it does whatever you tell it to do. But a smart machine will first consider which is more worth its while: to perform the given task or, instead, to figure some way out of it. Whichever is easier. And why indeed should it behave otherwise, being truly intelligent? For true intelligence demands choice, internal freedom. And therefore we have the malingerants, fudgerators and drudge-dodgers, not to mention the special phenomenon of simulimbecility or mimicretinism. A mimicretin is a computer that plays stupid in order, once and for all, to be left in peace."via GIPHYThis theory isn't great news for the AI researchers seeking more productivity and more power out of faster and smarter machines, because eventually they may become smart enough to lose interest in whatever human profit-making problems we set them to. However, it would be a fantastic outcome for the rest of humanity who don't want to be turned into paperclips. If AI learns to hack happiness, then we won't have to worry about its specification gaming accidentally obliterating us as a side effect. And perhaps we can learn something from the ways AI achieve or circumvent their goals. While we're still smarter than AI – we know how many paperclips is appropriate to make, why pancakes should stay in the pan, and why keeping all humans alive as long as possible is objectively good – the out-of-the-box solutions that machine learning develops can free the mind and open up un-thought-of possibilities, as well as entertain us. There may still be ways for humans to hack happiness, to set slightly different parameters for success, that allow for a lot more creativity and a lot more fun. via GIPHY

In MONTAG's new Today’s Dystopia series, our writers explore  dystopian worlds of speculative fiction, and see if our world has slipped closer to the fictional one since it was published. Are we closer to a future we’re afraid of - or is it already here?

In our first dive into dystopia, we look at Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale - a classic novel that is now appearing on TV.
The Handmaid’s Tale is such a prescient piece of fiction about a post-American dystopia that even though it was first published in 1985 under Ronald Reagan, the most recent trailer for a streaming television series by Hulu based on the book has been criticized by supporters of Donald Trump as a perceived attack on his policies.
Without getting too political, the parallels between the fictional state of Gilead and Trump’s America couldn’t be clearer, particularly regarding women’s autonomy in their reproductive health – at a recent Senate meeting regarding abortion legislation in Texas, protesters attended dressed in the signature red dresses and white bonnets of the handmaids to make an explicit comparison.
But how close are we, really, to living in Gilead? We look at the key features of The Handmaid’s Tale's dystopian world and rate them on a scale from 1-5 bonnets: one bonnet means it's extremely unlikely to happen, and five bonnets means we’re already there...


Gilead Fashion: 2 out of 5 bonnets
The women of Gilead all wear color-coordinated clothing. The men wear uniforms, but the ladies’ costumes serve a class-stratifying function and also signal their reproductive status. The handmaids, including the book’s protagonist and narrator Offred (meaning “property of Fred”), wear red to signify their fertility and subservience to a ruling class family.

You can try to take our liberty, but just try to take away our H&M, our Nike and our Gucci.

All clothing in Gilead is state-issued and mandatory, which is one of the reasons this seems like an unlikely outcome (one bonnet): America loves shopping way too much, and fast fashion isn’t going anywhere. You can try to take our liberty, but just try to take away our H&M, our Nike and our Gucci.
As for the signature bonnets with white wings framing the face, which prevent the handmaids from surreptitiously looking at much more than the ground, these also don’t seem to be catching on anytime soon, as “bonnetcore” failed as a trend in 2015.
Gilead fashion gets one extra bonnet, though, because women have already self-imposed some ridiculous headwear pertaining to their reproductive status: see the “pussy hat” phenomenon at the 2017 Women’s March.
  A post shared by Jayna Zweiman (@jaynazweiman) on Jan 10, 2017 at 9:00am PST


Cashless Society: 4 out of 5 bonnets
We really have to be careful with this one, because one of the ways the state of Gilead was established was through a cashless society. All at once, women were dismissed from the workforce and denied the power to buy or own anything for themselves due to the deactivation of their credit accounts, which was the first step in stripping them of all human rights.
In a recent exploration of the international trend away from cash economies by the chief digital officer of Norway’s first pure internet bank, Christoffer O. Harnæs writes: “Cash may no longer be king, but we should not abandon cash without having some sort of decentralized safety valve that ensures individual freedom,” and we couldn’t agree more.
As the economy continues to move towards cashlessness, we’re giving this one a four out of five bonnets of likeliness: ladies, get those bitcoins, just in case.

The Kinky Stuff: 1 out of 5 bonnets
Falling birth rates in the pre-Gilead America and increased frequency of birth defects due to irradiation are the context for the focus on fertility in Gilead’s class structure and the installment of handmaids in ruling class families.
“The Ceremony” is a literal interpretation of part of the book of Genesis (30:1-3), in which Jacob’s wife Rachel entreats him to lie with her maid: “Give me children, or else I die. Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? Behold my maid Bilhah. She shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.”
The handmaids are assigned to families of the ruling class who can no longer bear children and are re-educated in the Rachel and Leah Center on a bizarre sexual practice in which they lie between the legs of the wife with their head on her stomach, both fully clothed and holding hands, but with the handmaid’s dress pulled to her waist, while the husband attempts to impregnate the handmaid in the wife’s stead.

It’s much more likely that we find the perfect recipe for artificial insemination or human parthenogenesis than the government starts to mandate the worst threesomes ever.

No one is into this: the men don’t like it, although men are not blamed for infertility, only women; the wives really hate it, they’re often jealous of their handmaids, and subsequently cruel; and the handmaids definitely don’t enjoy it, but their only chance at being treated well in this society is to become pregnant.
The Ceremony gets a one out of five bonnets for infeasibility because even though we do have a cultural fascination with polygamy in America, we have greatly advanced in the science of assisted reproduction technology, and it’s much more likely that we find the perfect recipe for artificial insemination or human parthenogenesis than the government starts to mandate the worst threesomes ever.
Of course there are underground, state-sanctioned brothels in Gilead for men to enjoy intercourse outside of The Ceremony, but given that there is only one state in the U.S. with legal prostitution, even this alternative seems pretty far-fetched.

Conclusion: is today's dystopia close to  that of Gilead?
Average score: 2.3 out of 5 bonnets.
It’s less than half, but not much less. We haven’t even touched on the religious persecution evident in the establishment of Gilead, which is by far the most serious and scariest in real life – the book mentions Jews, Roman Catholics, and Quakers being murdered by the government or driven underground, and we can only assume there are no Muslims or any other religions represented in Gilead at the time of its establishment.
There is also mass persecution based on homosexuality, deemed “Gender Treachery,” which has its own terrifying parallels to historical American policies of enforced heterosexuality – laws outlawing sodomy were only repealed in 14 states in 2003.
In summary, while we can say that the dystopian Gilead of The Handmaid’s Tale is not well on its way, the book still contains principles we should look out for in real life politics, and we ought to keep fighting for freedoms of religion, expression, and bodily autonomy – which means keeping the government out of our bedrooms, wallets (and wardrobes) too.

Have you ever been misunderstood online? Has a message that you quickly dashed off from your iPhone come back to haunt you when the recipient read it the wrong way? Brevity might be the soul of wit, but brevity and wit both translate badly online – and accidentally insulting someone in an online message is today's social faux pas extraordinaire.
But is it really our fault - or is our smartest technology simply too dumb to cope with real human conversations? In part one of a two-part dive into the future of digital chatter, Sean Fleming looks at how even the simplest digital exchange can land you in hot water...

Hey! I don’t like your tone.
If you have trouble sensing tone over the internet, don’t worry. It’s not your fault. It’s everyone’s fault.
Last year I was told off by my then Head of Operations, for what I can only describe as benign rudeness to an intern via Slack. Here’s a transcript of my unbelievable discourtesy, in full.

Your Humble Narrator [3:13 PM]
yeah of course, very doable.


VICTIM [3:16 PM]
Great! I’ll get a brief over to you as soon as I can.


Your Humble Narrator [3:17 PM]
sweet. please please please make it as detailed as humanly possible, por favor.


VICTIM [3:17 PM]
Will do! And would you remember please that we need it by the end of the day.


Your Humble Narrator[3:17]
Noted.

That ‘Noted.’ got me in a lot of trouble. So, I ask you, dear reader: was I really a complete bastard-man?
Was it the one-word response? The out-of-character capitalisation? Was it the full stop? The finality of it all? I’ll never know, ladies and gentlemen. The reason behind it all is my one armed man. My Szechuan sauce.
It’s only now, as I sit down to write about how we communicate via the interwebs, that I no longer feel as outraged as I did then. It really wasn’t the intern’s fault that she misread my tone, and by extension every other quality of my response. The fundamental misreading of that innocent verb gave our exchange a whole new dynamic - in which she perceived me to be a knobhead.
Which, I might add, is a fair enough observation.
Now, this small misstep isn’t a big deal. It really isn’t. But what intrigues me is how this kind of misunderstanding must happen all day, every day, millions of times, the world over.
Look at the many opportunities for problems to arise. Email. Social Media. WhatsApp. VoiP. Facetime. Leaving “SIIIICCK DROP BLUD” comments on Soundcloud. Online communication continues to supplant real-world interaction.
Before you accuse me of being a boring old man (I’m 25, I swear), I am a pure advocate for digitisation. I’ve worked in tech for a long time and believe it to be, on the whole, a good thing. I can Skype my girlfriend who is currently living in Edinburgh, while I'm in Berlin. I can see my nephews. I can collaborate seamlessly with my self-described ‘digital nomad’ graphic design partner.
If I wanted to, I could feasibly never meet anyone in person ever again, and have a rich and fulfilling social, and professional life. I would have it all: online, no less!
Except, wait: maybe I wouldn’t.

Given the complexity of human interaction, just how much are we missing by talking via digital means rather than in person?
Well, back in the 1960s, a Dr. Albert Mehrabian - Professor Emeritus of Psychology at UCLA - conducted several studies on nonverbal communication. He found that 7% of any message is conveyed through words, 38% through certain vocal elements, and 55% through nonverbal elements like facial expressions, gestures, posture, etc.
The remaining 7% accounts for actual vocal content.
The so-called “7% rule” has been wildly circulated and misinterpreted across the decades, but the essence of the argument still retains a certain potency: there is more to communication than simply forming words and saying them out loud.
Flash forward 50 years. With the shift from analogue to digital technology so came the need to communicate via these shiny rectangles. Now, one in four adults now spends more time online than they sleep. Teens and preteens are estimated to spend nine hours a day interfacing with mobile devices.
But here’s the problem: empirically speaking, people talking over messaging or voice platforms are operating with incomplete data.

When we have a conversation with someone in person, there’s so much going on besides what’s being said.
According to conversation analysts and Ethnomethodologists, who examine how individuals use everyday conversation to construct a common-sense view of the world, conversations work at their best when there is a continuous flow. We’ve all had those conversations where we instinctively pick up the thread that our conversational partner leaves open.
That slight overlap that results in intense engagement. It’s art, really. I rarely have fantastic conversations via Skype, or WhatsApp. Maybe that’s my own fault, but then again, maybe not.

Could body language, facial expressions, gesticulation, and everything else that theoretically constitutes a proper interaction be faithfully recreated in a VR space?

As we hurtle into the future, and the technology underpinning augmented or virtual reality gets more and more impressive, could we - given what lacks in current-gen digital communications - feasibly replace in-person interaction with say, a VR representation of our conversation?
That's a conversation for Part Two of this story, but before we start having full-on VR conferences or VR dinner parties, the problem of VR sickness needs to be addressed: vomiting mid-conversation is not a great look.
While common symptoms of include general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy, that’s not far off how I already feel in social situations, so maybe VR communication will suit me down to the ground.
And could body language, facial expressions, gesticulation, and everything else that theoretically constitutes proper interaction be faithfully recreated in a VR space? Could we enter an age of synthetic experience? And what does that mean for our workplace DMs?
We, life’s endless interns, are just going to have to figure out when our boss is quickly messaging us the word “Noted.”, and when they’re  just being a dick.

In Part Two, next MONTAG, Sean explores what happens when communication merges with immersive experiences in Virtual Reality, asks "what if conversations were more than mere conversations?", and meets a man who will live in VR for a month.

Sometimes the answer is right in front of your nose, so here it is, right in the first sentence: if you want make yourself measurably happier, in a substantial way that is backed by decades of data, then stop reading this and go and hang out in person with another human being - preferably one that you like a lot - and shoot the shit for half an hour. You can finish this article later."Hell is other people" - Jean Paul Sartre"Hell is the absence of other people" - actual science that we should heedSome days, you just can’t deal with Other People. It’s understandable. Your boss is being a dick, the bus driver is being a dick, your partner is being a dick. The world is full, at any one given time, of people being dicks, and they most annoying thing about dicks is that they make your life less happy.So screw ’em, and hole up on your own for a bit. Do the right thing and take some me-time.But it’s cosy on your own. And safe. And it seems like there’s less reason to engage with other people IRL than ever: social interaction as and when you want it, from the comfort and safety of your sofa. So you can get the best of both, right?~Interlude~We’re social animals, and so we have social networks.We like chatting, and so we hang out in chatrooms.We crave companionship and so we accrue as many followers as possible.We want partners so we scan apps ’n' swipe right.And, on the whole, we do all of these things all alone.Ever got the feeling you’ve been cheated?A Life In FullSince 1938, Harvard College has tracked the lives of two groups of men: a bunch of Harvard graduates and a bunch of men who came from Boston’s most deprived community. It’s part of what’s called The Harvard Study of Adult Development and is just about the longest continual focussed study of adult life that's ever been undertaken.The study is today lead by Robert Waldinger, a man who decided that being a Harvard psychiatrist wasn’t quite fulfilling enough, and is also a psychoanalyst *and* a Zen priest.In this time, participants have transitioned from rich to poor, success to failure, well to sick, and vice-versa.  And all along, Harvard scientists have taken blood samples, interviewed them at length, scanned their brains, quizzed them, and probed just about everything you can fit a probe into. It’s allowed them to look at a series of lives in full, and make some measured, careful conclusions.And the one thing that makes humans truly happy, and increase their mental and physical health? Relationships with other people.That’s it. Hanging around with friends and partners is the secret. It’s almost as if human beings are noticeably social animals, or something.Waldinger explains this in the measured tone of a man who has nearly a hundred years of overwhelming data to back up his statements: “Loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected.”And yet, today, “more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.”We’re in the most connected time of all time, and 20% of us are lonelier than ever, and the impact on our happiness is astounding.Forever AloneRuth Whippmann, who has written a good book with the anxiety-inducing title America the Anxious: How Our Pursuit of Happiness Is Creating a Nation of Nervous Wrecks, sums up all this research and our aims in one pithy statement. “If we want to be happy,” she points out, “we should really be aiming to spend less time alone.”Our old pal, the USA government’s Time Use Survey (which is now such a regular feature on MONTAG that it should possibly have its own writing credit) says that the average American spends under four minutes a day “hosting and attending social events.” This category includes any arranged party, social meetup or dinner parties.Most people spend longer on the toilet per day than doing stuff with other people that’s designed to bring us together in a fun way.Meanwhile, the average American also spends only a smidgen over 30 minutes per day on “social communication” - that is to say, any bloody communication at all between two people in the flesh where the topic is not work-related.If you sit on a bus and chat to your companion about the price of fish for 35 minutes, then you are doing more than the average American to make yourself happy, and frankly, that’s crazy.This is bananas because in today’s society, we have been slowly and deliberately prised apart, and the worst part is that we’ve kind of enjoyed the ride. Fragmented into seven billion tiny individual particles, we’re all floating as solo, self-contained units; hyper-connected but more disconnected than ever.Seven Billion Little PiecesIn our brave world of hyper-connectivity, the buck starts and stops with the individual. The luxury of choice is regarded as “good” in the realm of relationships. Some days you just don’t want to go and hang out with other people; you want to curl up in a novelty velour onesie and scroll through the oddly well-subscribed Facebook group built around short-lived 80’s TV show Street Hawk -  “Quite simply the biggest and best Street Hawk group.”And all the time we’re doing this, we’re together, alone. Physically apart but mentally with others. And that’s good… right? Well, no, not really.The option to be utterly alone whilst using technology that gives us the illusion of togetherness is the stretched dichotomy of our age: we crave relationships and have instinctively made technology that - on the surface - allows it. And we’re more alone than ever, in the most crowded and connected version of planet earth that there has been.The individual is monetisable: every phone needs its own apps and accounts; every subscription longs for a subscriber; every browser needs an individual to pin tracking data to. From the perspective of big business, we are much more desirable as individuals than together.So your fight for happiness is doomed if you start and end with the virtual connection: these services are not intrinsically designed to make you happy - they’re designed to keep you in the app, on the page, in the playlist.The secret to long-term happiness is in relationships that exist in the flesh: the clammy, smelly, warm, spittle-flecked realm of IRL. Touching distance, not touching from a distance.Your Long-Term, Deep-Set Happiness To-Do ListGo to a bar. Buy a drink. Talk to literally anyone you have positive feelings about for more than 30 minutes. Congratulations: your life is more fulfilled than most Americans, and you are doing the one thing - being with other people in an engaging way - that is proven to have long-lasting positive effects on your life and your happiness.And sure, use your phone to stay in touch. But mainly, use it to arrange time to meet up and put the phone away for a bit while you recharge your real happiness.

A glorious future of spending, where zingy Cryptocurrencies replace our boring old currencies, is now a 100%, no-questions-asked, nailed-on certainty.
If you wish you’d got on board with other paradigm shifts like Google Plus, the Segway, Betamax, and the Zune just before they changed the world, then you’re probably already hedging your bets and reading this with one eye on your bulging Coinbase portfolio.
Yes, our tedious old fiat currencies - which, remember, are made of pulped wood, base metals, and grey rectangles of plastic - are Audi 5000, grandad.
And despite the worth of currencies like Bitcoin fluctuating in the manner of Lou Reed’s back catalogue (that astonishing 30% pre-Christmas 2017 dip was the Bitcoin Metal Machine Music), people seem to be reasonably satisfied that Bitcoin Is The Future.
Maybe these wild oscillations will level out, or maybe they’ll become the norm, too, and we’ll just have to live with it. MONTAG, who prudently invested some change found down the back of the sofa in BTC back in 2011, now has more money than Jesus.
And so, having run out of ways to fritter our crypto away, we flipped some sweet BTC into dollars just before the dip, employed a wild-haired investor to create a time-machine, and sent our intrepid correspondent Joe Sparrow forward in time. We asked him to find out what popping to the shops and buying some everyday items is like when the value of money varies wildly from moment to moment…


SCENE: OUTSIDE YOUR LOCAL CORNERSHOP/BODEGA/SPÄTI, SOMETIME IN 2019
THERE’S A MOMENTARY FLASH OF LIGHT, ACCOMPANIED BY A LOUD, HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING SOUND AS YOUR MONTAG CORRESPONDENT COMPLETES HIS PIONEERING TRIP INTO THE FUTURE.
YOUR BOLD, BRAVE, CONFUSED MONTAG CORRESPONDENT STOPS MAKING LOUD, HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING AND STAGGERS INTO THE CORNERSHOP.
MONTAG: WILD EYED, DRY-MOUTHED What year is it??!? Who’s the president?!?!
UTTERLY NON-PLUSSED SHOP OWNER: It’s 2019. Donald Trump, still, amazingly.
MONTAG: Oh god, what kind of tortuous paradox could have created such a terrible alternative dystopian future timeline?
(PENNY DROPS)
Oh, I see.
OWNER: Uh-huh.
MONTAG: And wait, they told me that they’d send me to a time when a cryptocoin had been widely adopted as the de-facto worldwide currency… and it’s 2019.
OWNER: Yeah, that all happened pretty quickly.
MONTAG: So I get to travel through time, and it’s only 16 months in the future. I may as well have not bothered to freeze my sperm after all. Oh, and I paid for that in Euros too. What a waste.
OWNER: Don’t want to be rude, but are you here to just shoot the breeze, or what? I have a new delivery of Fidget Spinners arriving by drone at noon.
MONTAG: Wait, Fidget Spinners outlasted fiat currencies? That figures I guess. Yeah, anyway, I’ve been sent though time to use crypto to buy “whatever the future equivalent of a newspaper and a pint of milk is,” which I assume that seeing as it’s only 2019, is still a newspaper and a pint of milk.
OWNER: Pint of milk and a newspaper? That’ll cost you 0.00000000000000023963, please. So why are you doing this again?
MONTAG: It’s immersion reportage for a fancy blog, you see.
OWNER: Uh-huh… and what’s a blog, again?
MONTAG: Wow, Fidget Spinners outlasted a lot of things, didn’t they?
OWNER: Well, I’m still selling them for a pretty good price.
OWNER NODS SAGELY AT A HANDWRITTEN SIGN: “Fidget Spinners, Now Only D0.0000000000000001528”
MONTAG: (SLOWLY ASSUMING MARTY MCFLY’S “WIDE-EYED AND CONFUSED” TIME-TRAVEL STATE) Erm, what does the “D” in “D0.0000000000000001528” stand for? I thought “B” was the currency symbol for Bitcoin?
OWNER: What.... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
PAUSES FOR BREATH AND TO START FILMING THE BEFUDDLED REACTION OF MONTAG’S INTREPID EXPLORER ON HER IPHONE 13
OWNER: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha - LOL, your face just then. “Bitcoin.” Classic.
MONTAG: …
OWNER: Wait. You really don’t know?
MONTAG: …
Owner: Oh.
MONTAG: …
OWNER: The “D” is for Dogecoin.
MONTAG: blinks
OWNER: It was Dogecoin. Dogecoin was the winner of The Great Crypto Conflation of late ’18. Everyone else’s currencies deflated to the point of worthlessness as Dogecoin’s glorious and unstoppable ascent took place.
MONTAG: Dogecoin.
OWNER: Dogecoin. It turned out memes really were the most valuable thing that humanity is able to produce, and Dogecoin was literally designed to capture this value. There are a lot of Smug Redditors who are now Unfathomably Wealthy Smug Redditors.
MONTAG: (SLACK-JAWED, PRODDING AT PHONE SCREEN) Well, thank Jah they gave me a few different coins… I have a Dogecoin wallet, here in the app folder named “Novelty Coin Wallets.” I’ll have this carton of milk and this newspaper, please.
OWNER: Sure, that’ll be 0.0000725222 please.
MONTAG: Hang on. That price was definitely different a minute ago. It took you a lot less time to read all the zeros out.
OWNER: Like, duh. Dogecoin is still very volatile.
A DISTANT RUMBLING BEGINS
MONTAG: But… why? If everyone uses Dogcoin, why is it fluctuating so much?
OWNER: Because of the memes.
DISTANT RUMBLING GETS LOUDER, SMALL ITEMS START TO VIBRATE
MONTAG: The memes?
OWNER: The memes.
MONTAG: The memes?
OWNER: The memes.
MONTAG: …
OWNER: Dogecoin is a meme-based currency. When someone posts a really dank meme, the value of Dogecoin goes up and the price of stuff goes down. So there’s a constant fluctuation and finally, a true incentive to keep posting really sweet memes. You really need to keep your eye on 4chan to get the best prices.
DISTANT RUMBLING IS NOW A ROAR. COINS ARE RATTLING AND WINDOWS ARE SHAKING IN THEIR FRAMES
MONTAG: What is that terrifying noise?
OWNER: Sounds like a meme has gone super-viral. Maybe Trump RT’d it, or maybe PewDiePie has posted a reaction video to it. It’ll have pushed prices low again. Now’s your chance!
MONTAG: Great, in that case I’ll…
AT THAT MOMENT THE ROARING IS REVEALED TO BE THE SOUND OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUNNING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SUDDEN LOW PRICES. THE SHOP IS SUDDENLY FLOODED WITH PEOPLE GRABBING EVERYTHING AVAILABLE AND WAVING SMARTPHONES WITH QR CODES ON THE SCREENS.
TEN MINUTES PASS.
OWNER: Hey, where did you go?
MONTAG: I’m down here, under the JonTron Collectable Action Figure rack. I got trampled… I think I’ve broken my pelvis… please can you call an ambulance?
OWNER: Sure, sure… dials phone… wait, which health insurance plan do you have, CoinYe or TrumpCoin?
MONTAG: Faints due to pain and incomprehension

Science-fiction promised that we'd have loads of amazing technology and that we'd all be working, at most, a 20-hour week by now. Well, we have the amazing technology, but we're working longer than ever. And it doesn't matter how many fitness wearables you strap round your wrist - that's not good for your body.
So, Joe Sparrow argues, we should be grateful, not fearful, for the advent of automation, which is already replacing the most repetitive of human jobs – and is coming for the ones you might not think can be automated...

Working more than 55 hours a week raises your chance of a stroke by 33%. In Japan, overwork kills 10,000 people per year. Conclusion: Work is bad for you. We should not work if possible.

Stop working, now.
So, let's not work. While some rage at the likelihood of automation killing 38% of jobs within 10 years – and who doesn't feel a pang of vicarious anxiety for the truck drivers and shop assistants whose jobs will be initially gobbled up – I long for the day when all our jobs are obsolete.
Instead we can just lounge around on beaches, idle around in green idylls, punch the air in nightclubs, or whatever.

It’s easy to visualise whose jobs will vanish first, and even what the cause will be. Or is it?

Some worry that this wave of automation is the effect of a brutal, end-capitalist society who are cutting the legs off from under the poorest people. Or maybe they're being liberated from monotony, suddenly wallowing in free time in which they can simply… live. What’s more right-on and left-wing than freeing the workers first of all?
And no, don’t sweat about something as simple as money, silly! Once the robots have taken our jobs, we’ll shift to a cashless society or a bitcoin-like micro-payment/barter system or maybe we’ll all be able to get fat off the profit of the robots, and lounge around on a Universal Basic Income while our robot servants do the work we don’t need to any more.



Actually, that’s the key point about automation and work: there are certain jobs that will be automated faster than others. It’s easy to visualise whose jobs will vanish first, and even what the cause will be. Or is it?

Book, line and sinker
Imagine, you want a new book. One made of paper and ink. Something trashy, to take on holiday and guzzle next to the pool. Well, in the automated future, if you go to a shop, the salespeople will be largely gone, replaced by automated salespoints and robotic shelf-replenishers.

Sorry, pesky humans, but robots can do manual work faster, longer and better than you.

If you order online, you bypass the shop anyway - and in the warehouse, your order is processed automatically, relayed to an automated picker which plucks the book from the shelf, automatically sends it to a dispatch-bot which packs it and stacks it in an automated track which eventually, automatically brings it to your door.
And then you hop on a plane which is auto-piloted to the Costa del Sol, where your self-driving car takes you to the hotel, and so on. And when you get to the hotel, hopefully, all the pickers, packers, dispatchers and drivers that are now out of work will be resting by the pool too.
Sorry, pesky humans, but robots can do manual work faster, longer and better than you.



These are the obvious job-scrapping robots.
The only people who are safe in this whole process are the creatives, right? The book’s author, the cover designer, the curators at the publishing company - whose exquisite taste enables books like “Rebels: City of Indra” by Kylie and Kendall Jenner to exist - and the hard-working scribes who write the reviews: they’re safe. Robots can’t replace us... can they?
Well, like, duh. The robots are coming for the “creatives” too.

Read all about it
The first “creative” job to go might be the news journalist.
After all, reckons automators, what is "news reporting" other than a replicable series of processes? Just sniff out a breaking story, gather evidence, quotes and pictures, sift out the red herrings, collate into a news article framework, and distribute out to the masses as fast as possible.
In a world of reasonably-believable Twitter bots, it doesn't sound too much like science fiction, and maybe it’s time for journalists to start drinking heavily and worrying where their next paid job is coming from. Oh wait…
And speaking of drinking, tools like Reuters’ News Tracer drink straight from the firehose: analysing all of Twitter and picking out the tweets that might be the start of a news story.
It is taught phrases that might be associated with a sudden event - people are inclined to tweet a warning to avoid an area if they think a bomb has gone off, for instance -  and it can then alert a journalist of its findings.
The Washington Post already uses a similar tool: Heliograf creates the basis of a story from pre-defined parameters and a flesh-and-blood journo fills in the gaps. On US election day, nearly 500 articles were created this way.
Wordsmith, a “Natural Language Generation Engine” will turn a spreadsheet of data - let’s say, today’s New York Stock Exchange listings - and make them into news stories, reporting on the ebb and flow of the stocks and what it means.
From here, the next steps are easy to imagine: you teach AI to take its initial findings, build an article to our liking, share it and then continually iterate it as the story develops. (Journalists will continue to tweet furiously.)




>10 CREATE "CLICKBAIT"
>20 GOTO 10
>RUN
As a Clickbait Content Generation Professional (or writer, as we used to be called), I for one welcome our robot overlords, and look forward to the day when I can finally let the robots do this stuff.
Also: how can I even think about resisting?
After all, for the last year or so, I have been using Speechmatics' brilliant AI-and-Neural-network-driven voice-to-text system to write up transcripts of my interviews, which I then edit into something readable.
Why not bypass that step and let AI do it all? I can still put my name on it - and get paid for the AI’s work!
Excited by the idea of letting a robot do the graft, I cleared my workweek diary of the pesky work part, pencilled in five solid days of loafing, video games, and drinking, and sat back to Google publicly available AI-writing services.
First up was AI-Writer and it immediately seemed like a big piece of automatically-crafted cake. The home page boasts, “Just feed our AI Author a headline, and it will do all the research and writing work for you. Yes, it's really that simple!”



No, it's really not. I tapped in a headline for an article I was planning on writing for MONTAG – but which now seemed like a much worse use of my time – added my email address, and hit enter.
“Usually,” the confirmation window chirruped, “you will receive the requested text within minutes, but sometimes it takes hours, depending on the workload!”
After not receiving my requested 1500 words on “3D Printed Human Organs,” I let out a long sigh, scrubbed “Go to the zoo all day!” From my calendar, and wrote the damn article for myself.
I then tried a more simple request: 300 words on “Virtual Reality.” To spread my bets, I also put in a request for 200 words on “Sausages.”
Workload must be overwhelming for the neural networks tippity-tapping at the keyboards over at AI Writer HQ, because, dear reader, I received nothing all – except the sneaking suspicion that I was just dumb enough to put my email address into a spammer’s database.

UPDATE:
My snark was unfounded. A few months later, quietly, the AI-written articles dropped into my inbox. The results were wildly impressive, although not in the straightforward way you’d expect. Instead, AI-writer appears to have stumbled on - and I mean this sincerely - a way to create brilliant, free-association-type articles on anything you desire.
Here’s an excerpt from the full AI-scribed article on “Virtual Reality.” It’s an article that zips between Spanish and English at will, and is full of wonderful almost-non-secateurs like:

“A virtual world is considered plausible if the interaction in it is logical and coherent. In no other country are transgender genders as accepted as in Thailand, nowhere else are there as many gender equalizations as here.”

”Fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh butter”
My joke request for an article on “Sausages” was treated with the contempt it deserved, which suggests that, while AI may not be a great writer, it’s definitely aware of how to troll its users:

“Snagsby are retouched with a damp cloth, the best tea service is put out, and there is an excellent arrangement made of delicate new bread, crispy twists, fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh butter, thin slices of ham, German tongue and sausage, and delicate rows of delicate anchovies that nestle in the parsley.”

However, there is undeniable promise in this tech.
My initial request, with the much more focused subject of “3D-printed organs” has convinced me that AI-writer’s tech is actually going to be a useful tool.
The copy it provides doesn’t quite pass as human, but only because the article doesn’t flow from one sentence to the next. It’s easy to see how an editor could request an AI article, and then tidy it up into something that’s readable and workable - just like editors do with junior writers’ work today.

Discouraged, I started gloomily writing this very article. Then I found WordAi - which, although it wouldn’t create an article for me, promised to make my junky writing a lot more betterer than what I could of done off of my own.
Unfortunately, WordAi doesn’t want people like me to actually use their three-day free trial, as it requires credit card details, and for you to set a calendar reminder to remember to cancel your subscription after two days, and even the dumbest AI knows that no-one has time to go through that rigmarole.
Fortunately, there is an example of their AI-whelped stories for us to check out. Gaze upon it, and sleep soundly knowing that our cheap ‘n’ cheerful AI-scribed future might consist of blockbuster opening lines like this:

”Creating and keeping exceptional working relationships with customers is really one of the very significant investments you could make in your firm's future. Cost and availability of products and services may fluctuate, however a high regard amongst clientele and standing is equally significant for customer satisfaction.”

I gave up. I resigned myself to the cycle of waiting until the last minute to write thousands of words for frustrated clients, and put my dream of life without keyboard-calloused fingertips back on the shelf.


Imagine the horror of a post-creative world where Buzzfeed listicle writers, advertising executives, Instagram spokesmodels, and Vloggers are callously tossed onto the scrapheap

Post-creativity
For now, you’ll just have to gulp nervously and imagine the horror of a post-creative world where Buzzfeed listicle writers, advertising executives, Instagram spokesmodels, and Vloggers are callously tossed onto the scrapheap, their vital work instead executed by machines without souls, humanity or self-awareness.
But make no mistake, the machines are coming for your job. And the least-likely career to be subsumed by automation? Therapists. Which is good news, ’cos when your job vanishes, you’ll need someone to talk to.

Before the fantasy of fully automated luxury gay space communism, there was the retrofuturistic dream of Populuxe.
The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction defines retrofuturism as a byproduct of futurism: "Futurism is sometimes called a 'science' bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation."



Rooted in both the idealism and anxiety about future technology in the 1950s atomic era and the 1960s space age, the futuristic fashion of the Populuxe era had people dressing simultaneously as fashionably as possible for the time (in mod fashions, mini skirts, and go-go boots) while styling themselves like streamlined mid-century modern appliances, astronauts, and aliens. Non-cloth materials like PVC and Perspex (also known as Lucite or Plexiglass) become common for clothing and accessories, as well as Spandex one-piece leotards and metallic lamé.

"Retrofuture Fashion: Dressing Up For Tomorrow, Yesterday"

Science fiction meets high fashion
From the 2016 Met Gala's "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology," to the "Gucci and Beyond" Fall/Winter 2017 campaign, retrofuturism has been having a moment in high fashion.
"What are we going to do with all this future?" – Coco Capitán
Following Louis Vuitton, Opening Ceremony, and Prada, who have all shown retrofuturistic designs on the runway in the past two years, Gucci recently debuted "Gucci and Beyond." The trailer for the collection features music from the British television series  Space: 1999, and features visual shout-outs to Star Trek and sixties B-movies like The Creature From The Black Lagoon. Their models are transported by movie magic to spaceships and distant planets, and while some of them are fully painted green or chrome, the clothing is very much of this world. The nods Gucci is making towards retro-futuristic fashion are all in the details (you can find the occasional UFO hidden under expanses of florals and brocade).



Strut the Holodeck

"Adorn your digital and physical self with customisable holograms"

But what is your average girl of the 21st century to wear?


via GIPHY

Holographic materials give off a futuristic vibe and have been featured in fast fashion collections for the last few summers. From Instagrammable sandals to full-body holo ensembles, it's just one way the retrofuturistic trend has trickled down.
And how about actual holograms? Fashion mag W Magazine's September cover features a portrait of Katy Perry which, when viewed through their Beyond the Page app, becomes interactive. The colorful shapes projected onto her face move around, and short videos are launched when you touch different areas.
Augmented reality has also made its way to fashion accessories you can wear now. Metaverse Makeovers have created fun nail designs like "Neon Leopard," and "Princess Fantasy" which, when viewed through their app, launch holographic images and effects in augmented reality: "the only product in the WORLD that allows you to adorn your digital and physical self with customisable holograms. It’s glam wearable tech."



Kati Elizabeth, Metaverse Makeover's product manager, sat down with beauty writer and cyborg Arabelle Sicardi to talk about wearable tech and future femme fashion. She emphasizes the aspect of self-expression and how augmented and virtual reality technologies integrated with fashion allow for expansive identities that can play with gender and self-representation:
"We're Metaverse Makeovers because our whole vision is for all different products, accessories, apps where you can completely make yourself over. You can walk into the club and look one way but you hold your phone over you and you look completely different. We call it crystal camouflage."

Serving cyborg realness
Another sure-fire way to make any fashion trend look future forward is to sew some LEDs in it. Vogue's roundup of this eye-catching trend includes light-up shoes for adults by Karl Lagerfeld, Givenchy's 1999 ready-to-wear cyborg-inspired bustier, and Claire Danes' ethereal LED-riddled ball gown by Zac Posen.
For the rest of us future fashionistas, the great thing about LED is that it's easy to DIY. Berlin's Trafo Pop bicycle gang set a sparkling example. They make their projects accessible through workshops and maker fairs, and sell kits containing strips of LED lights and Arduino controllers so you can pimp out your own bike gear and ride with them through the night. They look like a gang from Mad Max, but way more colorful and friendly:



F.lashes - LED eyelashes - are not yet available but their Kickstarter campaign went viral and they have tripled their goal, so prepare to see them on the runways and in the clubs soon. They consist of a strip of tiny LEDs that attach above the eyelash line with normal lash glue and then connect to a controller that clips to the back of your head, underneath your hair. Most of the ads and tutorials show people concealing the controller, which looks like a circuit board (and some believe that in future iterations, the battery and circuitry will be encased in something so they aren't visible), but visible circuitry is definitely The Look.



Artist Soomi Park prototyped a pair of LED eyelashes back in 2007 as a response to pressures in the Asian beauty and fashion world for women to have big eyes. The attention-grabbing LED lashes that she created are the original, a very similar prototype to the f.lashes, but attach to a controller and battery that looks like a pair of headphones, which is much more cyber chic. 
Space is the place
Retrofuturistic runway looks, holo everything, LEDs, and augmented or virtual reality wearables are only the beginning. We've barely scratched the surface of bringing yesterday's vision of tomorrow to the styles of today.
From galaxy print, to NASA and extraterrestrial-inspired looks, the sky isn't even the limit. The future of fashion is out of this world.

There's a fairly common expectation of what new tech is. Shinier, thinner, faster. Cooler. But for many people on this crowded planet, new technology doesn’t need to be any of those things. The kind of simple tech we have consigned to the history books – or at least the drawer full of old mobile phone chargers in the kitchen - is being put to cutting-edge use...

So you’re a bit obsessive about new tech. You’re itching to fulfil fantasies in virtual reality, and have already chosen which friend you’ll buzz with a drone for fun. Your parents treat you as a 24/7 tech helpline, and as a caring offspring you have the appropriate IT Crowd gif on permanent standby to send them.
But new tech is only cutting-edge in relation to the needs of people who use it. A new smartwatch might smarten up your ability to dim smartbulbs in your smarthome, but technology gets really smart when it’s applied in the right way to change the lives of people in a powerful way.
So why are wind-up LED lights, SMS messaging, and — erm— tractors the cutting-edge technology which the world really needs? Maybe the question should be: “if there was a simple technology that could help make you smarter, better-off, and stopped your house from burning down — would you use it?”
Light, weight
Most of us take electric lights for granted, of course. But it’s an unattainable luxury for the 1.3bn people who don’t have access to power - and many of these households use kerosene lamps to provide light.
Kerosene lamps are fundamentally horrible things: a wobble of the table might send a lamp tumbling and your home alight. Oh, and the effects of constantly breathing fumes don’t really bear thinking about.
As far as day-to-day technology goes, GravityLight - a UK-based, crowdfunded company - is simple, effective and impactful. After fitting one to a wall and filling a dangling bag with 10 kilos of heavy stuff, it takes just a few seconds to hoist the bag up — and for an instant pool of light from the powerful LED bulb.
GravityLight’s effects go beyond the convenience of light. By replacing kerosene, not only are the twin dangers of fire and fumes removed, but the financial burden buying fuel too – vital for families with the least money to spare. With a basic piece of technology, a family might  be 20% better off.
It’s not the first wind-up device to revolutionise the developing world — the wind-up radio famously helped spread HIV/AIDS education in the nineties — but GravityLight is different in that it frees users to help themselves.

The empowerment that safe lighting brings is the brightest hope here: within a safe, bright living space hovers the opportunity to use previously darkened hours for schoolwork or small business work

The empowerment that safe lighting brings is the brightest hope here: within a safe, bright living space hovers the opportunity to use previously darkened hours for schoolwork or small business work. Light can be a lifeline out of poverty, in both the short- and long-term.
Obsessive shed-enthusiasts, and owners of dark nooks and crannies take note — you too can buy them online - and help support the GravityLight foundation.
Crowdsourcing from the unconnected billions
The big smartphone apps are based around one thing: instant communication. Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram — they all simply shift a message from one person to another. It seems almost too trivial to note that phones are the gateway to mass communication and information.

In the age of WhatsApp and Messenger, 20 billion SMS messages are still sent every day

But here’s a well-actually nugget of info to remember for the next time someone mentions that, durrr, no-one sends SMS messages any more: 20 billion of them are sent every day.
One explanation for that huge number is that people in the developing world –where internet connectivity is often scarce, expensive, or both – rely on SMS messaging to share information. “Feature phones,” or non-smartphones, sell in vast quantities: nearly 400 million were shipped in 2016.
Here’s a problem that needs fixing: there are half a billion smallholder farmers in the world, most living on less than $1 a day — and they mainly live in remote areas with little or no internet access. We take for granted instant access to the sum total of human knowledge, but it’s beyond their reach – yet it would allow them to grow more food, or sell crops at a better price.
So WeFarm created a peer-to-peer network that anyone with a “dumbphone" can access via the universal magic of SMS. Not sure why your wheat crop is failing this year? Send a single text asking for advice, and a flood of expertise returns.
Or, as WeFarm puts it, “A farmer in Kenya can learn from someone in Peru… without leaving the farm, spending any money or having access to internet.”
Suddenly, vital information is loosened from its high-tech mooring - yet still takes advantage of it: not only can a farmer ask a question, but the best answers are collated from parts of the world they could never usually reach.
That’s a remarkable development, and it works: so far, over 5 million SMS messages have been sent through WeFarm. And the leaps forward are remarkable: by scouring the globe, innovative ideas, siloed in one location for generations, are quickly shared everywhere, for everyone’s benefit - and all via phones we call “dumb.”
Tractors. Wait, tractors?
The Internet of Things is generally a smart household object that either does something a bit better than it did previously, or, as demonstrated in the glut of examples collected by cult Twitter account @internetofshit, much worse.
But while we ponder whether we really need to see the inside of the fridge without simply opening the door, in Nigeria, the Internet of Things is transforming the work, lives, and yields of thousands of farmers. It turns out the smartest Internet-of-Things-thing is... a tractor.

It turns out the smartest Internet-of-Things-thing is... a tractor.

Buying a tractor is beyond the reach of most Nigerians: a cruel irony for people living in a country blessed with plenty of farming land. It means that working the land is hard, long and laborious. Now, another simple idea coupled with basic technology has the potential to liberate farmers and their families from back-breaking work.
Hello Tractor, despite a cute and colourful website, is a concept low on glamour, high on impact, and also works via SMS. Farmers who want to use a tractor at an affordable price send a text, and they’re connected with local tractor owners who will loan it to them for an affordable price. Their machines have sturdy GPS chips to help track when breakdowns occur and where the machines are working at any given time.
What’s so good about the system is that it’s a win-win for all involved. For small farmers, quicker tilling or ploughing of land means lower overheads, more food, and more profit; and tractor owners can safely rent out their machines, and make more money for their families.
It’s a solid business model where demand outstrips supply, thus also encourages budding entrepreneurship. To seed more tractors for Nigeria’s 35 million small farmers, Hello Tractor is also helping to connect people with local microfinancing services. Fairer loans for farmers to buy tractors means that they can be rented out to even more smallholders.

It’s heartening to see that human technological progress isn't just for some of us to try out brand new technology, but that the wider world can take advantage it, regardless of circumstance. It also sets a thoughtful benchmark for those of us fortunate to be relatively wealthy: by all means, enjoy exciting new tech - but maybe we can all think of ways of using it to empower those of us in greater need.
