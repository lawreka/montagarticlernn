          <h2 id="issuefourofmontagahrefissue4target_blankisaboutmodernmoneya">Issue four of MONTAG <a href="/issue4/" target="_blank">is about Modern Money</a>.</h2>
<p><strong>And in its purest sense, there’s nothing more modern than cryptocurrencies</strong>: when it comes to paying for stuff, they are somewhere between the bleeding edge, the wild west, and the new normal.</p>
<p>When people think about the future of money, they don’t think of <a href="https://youtu.be/81eU8Rq7j58?t=58s">foldin’ money</a> or swipin’ money, tappin’ money, or even a plastic card at all: they think of… nothing.</p>
<p>That’s because cyrptocurrencies like Bitcoin sorta-kinda don’t exist. They feel ephemeral. Yet they’re not. They exist. But you know, they also sort of don’t. And all this <em>yes, but, no but</em> makes tomorrow’s currencies seem out the reach of us, normal, <em>can-I-pay-with-cash-or-card?</em> spenders.</p>
<p>And that’s wrong, because cryptocurrencies are designed to be in our hands, and liberating us from banks, corruption, fraud and, well… banks.</p>
<p>The decentralised nature of cryptocurrency is its strength (transactions are recorded in a permanent audit trail, are viewable by anyone, and no-one controls the ledger) and, to newcomers, its weakness (OMFG what does that even mean, how does it even work, and how do I buy milk with it?)</p>

<p><strong>MONTAG prides itself on its glorious ignorance</strong>. And in this article, we’re arguing that you should not feel concerned that <em>Bitcoin et al</em> are utterly bewildering, intangible and infuriating.</p>
<p>Instead, we’re suggesting that this feeling is the default setting for dealing in the Glorious Crypto Future, and that you should embrace it, for the sake of humanity itself.</p>
<p>So here’s MONTAG’s guide to how to be able to tell your friends that you’re “really into Crypto right now” and not be lying, and yet still not really know anything about it.</p>
<p>Don't worry: it's written by someone who knows very little. Come on in, the Crypto’s lovely.</p>

<h2 id="onwhythetinybityouknowaboutcryptocurrencybytheendofthisadmittedlyconfusedarticlewillstillleaveyoumoreinformedandwealthierthan99ofpeople">On why the tiny bit you know about cryptocurrency by the end of this admittedly confused article will still leave you more informed (and wealthier) than 99% of people</h2>
<p><strong>There are a million breathless articles, forum posts, Twitter feeds, and Facebook groups</strong> about every single cryptocoin that try and explain how it works and why you should care. Every metaphor is tortured, every diagram an octopus-orgy of arms and blobs. It’s really hard to find a good, clear description of either Bitcoin (or any other coin) or the blockchain technology behind it.</p>
<p>That’s <em>A Good Thing</em>.</p>
<p>It’s good for the same reason that you don’t hear a good, simple description of how <em>banking</em> works. It’s really, really complex, and the “experts” only truly understand one part of it well, if at all.</p>
<p>Except with Bitcoin, and all the other crypocurrencies, it’s useful to learn something, anything, even if it’s half-true, only semi-correct, or only feels partially understandable, like a German compound word that you can’t translate directly into your own language.</p>
<p>That’s because crypto, while based around a completely transparent system, also means shunning <em>trust</em> itself, to an extent. Scary huh? But think about it: you’ve never seen your “money”. Trust is all that really keeps you from questioning the reality of your hard-earned Euros, Dollars, Pounds or Zloty.</p>

<h2 id="youvenevertouchedyourmoney">You’ve never touched your money.</h2>
<p>It's a number on a payslip, or in an app; a few digits that you transfer to your landlord each month. The coins and paper in your wallet are not money -they’re just something there in lieu of it (go on, read the small print, it’s pretty worrying, frankly).</p>
<p>It’s all rather nothing-y when you think about it. But that’s what money is: a complicated device with everything and nothing at its centre.</p>
<p>The only difference with Crypto is that <em>you’re</em> the bank now. You can’t trust a bank to take care of it. There are no banks: it’s all you. But as 2008’s worldwide simultaneous economic bed-shitting demonstrated, you can’t trust banks anyway. So take the power back!</p>
<p>Of course that also means taking back the risk, the panic and the worry. And that’s a big part of crypto, at least for now. The truth is that if you lose a piece of paper with a convoluted number on it, you lose all your money, forever.</p>
<p>But would you rather (literally) bet your mortgage on keeping a long number safe somewhere, or on some of Wall Street’s finest making a bizarro decision and sending the value of your house tumbling into a void forever?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="closeyoureyesandjump">Close your eyes and jump</h2>
<p>Imagine you are naked. And imagine Crypto to be a beautiful, valuable painting that you can access and keep, but only through 100 panes of that mottled glass they use in the windows of toilets. Bear with me. I told you the metaphors were bad.</p>
<p>To get closer to the painting and to see it more clearly, you’re going to have to go through a whole load of these panes of glass. So the ride will be painful, noisy, confusing, bloody, terrifying, and confusing (again) but you’ll feel utterly exhilarated with each leap towards clarity.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about reasons - there are no real reasons in the world of crypto. Just understand that the future is <em>that way</em> - through all those damn panes of glass.</p>

<h1 id="someassortedadviceiignoredonmyjourneybuyingcryptoandthenlaterlearntthehardway">Some assorted advice I ignored on my journey buying Crypto, and then later learnt the hard way</h1>
<p><strong>• Cynicism is a type of currency too</strong>: Essential advice from my MONTAG colleague Kathryn, quoting a running joke on Reddit’s many crypto forums: “The best day to buy Bitcoin is two years ago, the second best time is today.” This is always true.</p>
<p><strong>• Your perception of money-related panic and fear will mutate in relation to your investment:</strong> A tech-savvy friend lazily bought a small amount Bitcoin back in 2012 without really thinking too much about what to do with it.</p>
<p>The surprise in this story is not that he then lost the Bitcoin (there are a million stories about that too, and expect to read plenty of clickbait horror stories in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/">Daily Mail in the coming years</a>) but that when, five years later, he found it on the USB drive he left it on, as he realised it was now worth a small fortune, the excitement was wholly tempered by the wild reverse-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sehnsucht"><em>Sehnsucht</em></a> panic of Oh-my-God-but-what-if-I’d-lost-it-and-then-later-remembered-about-it-oh-god-oh-god. Fortunately you can buy whisky with Bitcoin, and he calmed down.</p>
<p><strong>• Everyone’s story is: “if only I’d invested earlier, I’d be so much richer now.”</strong> Stop right there, friend: this is the point of Bitcoin. Its price can only go up. So stop worrying and keep drinking the Crypto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor_Aid#Jonestown_massacre">Flavor-Aid</a>.</p>
<p><strong>• The idea of value itself is fluid and changing so who cares about those spikes and troughs</strong>: One of the earliest transactions using Bitcoin was when someone paid 20 Bitcoin for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2011/06/20/are-bitcoins-worth-their-weight-in-gold/#370d59fb7fbc">a pair of alpaca socks*</a>. Go to any Bitcoin exchange and check how much 20 Bitcoin would cost in fiat currency today: it’d be the same as a car.</p>
<p>But the socks were a great bargain at the time. So why even think about the equivalent fiat currency fee?</p>
<p>*<em>or something; like any new online community, the Alpaca Socks story is a kind of self-replicating myth: it can mean whatever you want and can be told however you like, with any intended moral you like.</em></p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Jw9YAoco2R7mo" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/looping-Jw9YAoco2R7mo">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p><strong>• When your friend who knows better says, “buy it now,” just do it</strong>: Yes, your investment may go down (and probably will.) You may lose it all. You may become incredibly wealthy. But that’s all in the short term: a crypto-enabled future is inevitable and anything you are left with, post-disaster, post-triumph, post-confusion, is going to be incredibly useful. <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78xqxb/the-guy-who-ruined-dogecoin">Except Dogecoin.</a> Poor Dogecoin.</p>
<p><strong>• You are the bank. So be the bank.</strong> Buying crypto is easy: you go to an exchange like <a href="LINK">Coinbase</a>, pay them money and they give you sweet, sweet cryptocoins in return.</p>
<p>But storing it is still confusing, despite many determined best efforts. So it’s easiest just to leave the coins on the exchange: a number on the screen that constantly changes in value. The excitement!</p>
<p>But here’s the point: if you keep your coins on an exchange <em>you don’t own your own money.</em></p>
<p>Put it anywhere else, and you own it. Keep them on the exchange, and you’re kind of still keeping a foot in the old way of using money, and crypto is all about going big, or going home, sunshine!</p>
<p>Losses, mistakes, panic, confusion compounded by more confusion, and desperate searches for that piece of paper with a random 128-character code on to unlock your utterly ethereal crypto-wallet for your utterly ethereal crypto-coins is what our crypto future is all about, baby!</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:59%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/cWIXHrrT3cKWc" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/wtf-news-money-cWIXHrrT3cKWc">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p><strong>• Buy a physical wallet to store your coins.</strong> Just do it: they look like a USB stick and cost ten times as much, and no, they don’t “store” your money (it doesn’t exist, remember, dummy!), but… well, put it this way - this writer slept better after buying one, and he doesn’t even really know why or how that is the case, but knows that it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>• HODL</strong>: if you don’t know what HODL means, don’t worry, it’s just another one of those in-jokes that you’ll learn to love, believe in and clutch close to your chest like a comfort blanket on those days when your <a href="https://cryptocoincharts.info">coin of choice’s value graph</a> suddenly decides to investigate what life would be like it if it hung around near the bottom of the y-axis for a while.</p>
<p>HODL sort-of means “hold” (as in, stop worrying and hold onto your investment) and sort of means Hold On for Dear Life (as in “I’m just going to HODL for a while and stop checking Coinbase every five minutes”). But of course, in the world of Crypto, it can mean whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>• Bullish BS</strong>: If anyone involved even tangentially in finance asks about your crypto-strategy, just glance around as if you have something very important to relay and keep quietly repeating that you are “Bullish on Crypto.” People will raise eyebrows and nod sagely.</p>
