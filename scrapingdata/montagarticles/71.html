<p>In Part 2, she tells the story of one man who actually disappeared completely.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="itsnowcommonpracticeforfutureemployerstosearchyoursocialmediabeforedecidingwhethertohireyou">It’s now common practice for future employers to search your social media before deciding whether to hire you.</h3>
<p>In this case, deleting all of your social data should only work in your favor.</p>
<p>No one is going to get a job for having great party pictures on their public Facebook profile, but certainly you could lose your chance at one for having a bad reputation online (those same “great” party pictures may not look so great to the HR manager).</p>
<p>So if you have any mention of drug use, illegal behavior, or other undesirable characteristics for future employment, you may be better off hiding your shady social media past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to know what your ex-partners looked like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to one study, <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/social-media-ghost-boyfriend">74% of people</a> will research each other on social media before dating. This is its own “hiring process” so to speak, but it goes in the other direction: not having any social media presence in a dating scenario is seen as creepy.</p>
<p>We want to know if there are more pictures than the ones specifically chosen for dating sites, if the interests listed on a profile appear to be genuine – and of course, what your ex-partners looked like.</p>
<p>When it comes to relationships, women in particular have a high level of skill in this kind of &quot;cyberstalking&quot; – it’s not creepy to know the details of someone’s life before you agree to meet them for coffee, because for some it’s a form of self-protection. (Men worry significantly less about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-37624831">dying from an encounter with a stranger they meet online.</a>)</p>
<h3 id="sobesidesyouremployersandpotentialromanticpartnerswhoelsewillcareifyoudisappearfromtheinternet">So besides your employers and potential romantic partners, who else will care if you disappear from the internet?</h3>
<p>The internet still mourns the sudden disappearance of one beloved programmer.</p>
<p>Known as “why the lucky stiff” or simply “_why,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">Jonathan Gilette</a> was an extremely active member of the Ruby programming community, best known for creating <a href="http://poignant.guide/">Why’s (Poignant) Guide To Ruby</a>, a humorously and brilliantly illustrated introduction to the Ruby programming language, which was published in 2004.</p>
<div style="width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;padding:10px;">
<img src="https://www.montag.wtf/content/images/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-10-at-15.56.09.png" style="max-width:100%;"><br>
from <a href="http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html" target="_blank">Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby</a>
</div>
<p>Before his “infosuicide,” he appeared at several programming conferences, but according to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.single.html">Annie Lowrey’s comprehensive Slate article on his disappearance</a>,</p>
<p><em>“He booked conference tickets under a pseudonym. He never put down a credit card in front of other Ruby conference participants, instead paying in cash. He would leave public gatherings by just disappearing. He had even waged a campaign to get his Wikipedia profile killed.”</em></p>
<p>For some reason, perhaps due to some strange obsession with his work and his mysterious identity, he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing">doxxed</a> in an extraordinary fashion. Someone created a Wordpress site called “<a href="http://whoiswhytheluckystiff.wordpress.com/">whoiswhytheluckystiff.wordpress.com/</a>” and revealed everything they could: his name, place of residence, photographs, phone numbers, educational details, and more.</p>
<p>Then in 2009, he mysteriously disappeared from the internet entirely, shutting down his personal website, Twitter, and Github page – deleting numerous repositories of valuable Ruby learning materials in the process. Luckily the Ruby community banded together in his wake to <a href="http://viewsourcecode.org/why/">save all of his projects</a> and have even continued maintaining many of them in his sudden absence.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="manypeoplequestionedifthedoxxedinformationon_whywasevencorrect">Many people questioned if the doxxed information on _why was even correct.</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=773106">Hacker News thread</a> has some alternative theories, and others wondered if “_why” wasn’t the moniker for some kind of collective. But at the time of the Slate reporter’s writing (2012) it was confirmed: _why was a real, singular person and he simply wanted to disappear.</p>
<p>Of course, due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a>, _why only became more famous.</p>
<p>In 2013, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/19/why-oh-why/">a mysterious book appeared</a> as a series of printer commands on his re-activated Github account, which was assembled into a book called “CLOSURE” which you can read on <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/136918361/Collected-PDFs-of-why">Scribd</a> or download from <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/CLOSURE">Github</a>.</p>

from CLOSURE
</div>
<p>The writings in CLOSURE are written in many different formats – photocopied handwritten notes, typed pages, comics – but their style reveals they could only have come from the mind of _why: the same whimsical and bizarre prose, but now turned on the concept of identity and anonymity.</p>

<h3 id="ourfinalcommuniqufromthemanwhodisappearedcompletelyarethoughtsfrombeyondthedigitalgrave">Our final communiqué from the man who disappeared completely are thoughts, from beyond the digital grave.</h3>
<p>They're on the significance, or otherwise, of one man’s life in the face of what he called the <em>“Leviathan”</em> – that is, the internet.</p>
<p>And they are suitably poetic final words on the unexpected value of a disconnected life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I didn’t realize this at first, but there is an enormous temptation (when you’re completely disenfranchised from society) to write a manifesto, a scathing one, that shreds apart all the fixations of that society (both real and imagined) and attempts to predict that society’s demise or to deliver up a host of cryptic and/or seemingly lucid stuff as a challenge for that society to live the way I do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m sure you expect (perhaps desperately WANT) me to spout off incendiary things. And I am tempted to: I’m totally disillusioned, I feel betrayed by computers, and on one hand: yes, I wrote hideous code for years. On the other hand: almost all code – IF NOT ALL CODE – is hideous!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sadly, this isn’t as incendiary as it sounds. Nothing can be incendiary or iconoclastic in the face of the Internet. There is no manifesto that I can write which will not be dwarved by the scalding, devouring Leviathan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I once thought the Internet was just a game, did you ever see it that way? But we all believe it too much. We really think it’s us up there! We’re those twinkling lights.”</p>
</blockquote>
