          <p><em>You might think that plugging a <a href="https://getgrover.com/de-de/gaming-and-vr/gaming-consoles">VR headset into your PS4</a> is cool (and it is) but imagine when that <a href="https://getgrover.com/de-de/gaming-and-vr/virtual-reality">VR headset</a> is also reading your brainwaves, and allowing you to <a href="https://getgrover.com/de-de/gaming-and-vr/games-xbox">control games</a> with your mind. Yeah, that's cool. And as Joe Sparrow learns, this tech is so close to reality, if you think about it really hard, it might just appear...</em></p>

<h2 id="mindthegap">Mind the gap</h2>
<p><strong>Mind Control has been comprehensively mined as a topic for good entertainment,</strong> including a slew of classic science fiction: <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> and <em>A Brave New World</em> both feature mind-control’s sinister possibilities, and <em>Star Wars</em> planted the idea of mind tricks squarely into popular culture.</p>
<p>There’s also, of course, some extremely enthusiastic and hot-under-the-collar online communities, such as the <em>Erotic Mind-Control Story Archive</em> (You'll have to Google it yourself), which hosts literally tens of thousands of amateur stories devoted to the adventures of sadly-ignored geeky men who suddenly discover an ability to control the minds of the women who have been doing all the ignoring.</p>
<p>You can guess what happens next.</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/OOZgoKTWchUic" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/weird-strange-mind-control-OOZgoKTWchUic">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Actually, maybe you can’t - the community seems to have developed a language of codewords-within-codewords; thus the text below <em>could</em> be the premise of an erotic story, but could <em>also</em> be the plot of a Brontë novel which has been run through Google Translate a few times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“While hunting a shapeshifter, a misanthropic thief and a hypnotist with a penchant for bimbofication clash with sultry fey—and encounter a strangely weak-willed young woman.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="whateveritallmeansonethingisforsure">Whatever it all means, one thing is for sure.</h2>
<p>The allure of mind control is strong. It consumes our thoughts. It’s as if we can’t think about anything else.</p>
<p>It’s safe to assume that the main tropes of mind control – the corny magic potions/mysterious crystals combo of erotic fiction or the benevolent governmental drugs ‘n’ hypnosis hypothesis of sci-fi – is not going to come to pass any time soon.</p>
<p><strong>But what about technology?</strong> It’s a given today that tech can do seemingly impossible things, like allow bit-players in <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/47230-15-times-paris-hilton-was-the-boss-of-kim-kardashian-in-case-you-forgot-who-invented">trashy reality TV shows become global superstars</a> - so could tech also make mind control a reality?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dontmindifido">Don't mind if I do</h2>
<p><strong>At this point it’s worth pausing to address the elephant in the room:</strong> it’s hard to talk about mind control without sounding like you’ve taken a spot in the upper strata of conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>And there is a rich, deep pool of theories to dive into, ranging from the plausible (1950s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">government-sponsored programmes</a>) via the shrug-inducing (<a href="https://youtu.be/PBl1ov3Wx_k">chemtrails</a>, always chemtrails), to the eyebrow-raising (your electrical appliances <a href="http://mindjustice.org">are out to get you</a>) - all of which are guaranteed to gobble up hours of your time.</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/uyyYkuXONIxlS" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/uyyYkuXONIxlS">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>However, the art of controlling minds using technology isn’t actually all that conspiratorial, or even that new. Maybe the first important distinction to make is between technology which is <em>mind controlling</em> and that which is <em>mind controlled.</em></p>
<p>You might think that the latter is the most plausible use of technology - after all, the brain is a truly mysterious grey blob – but the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/they-say-government-mind-control-is-realand-that-theyre-part-of-it">use of technology to “control” minds is actually decades old.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="mindyourself">Mind yourself</h2>
<p><strong>If we can agree that the intended outcome of mind control is to alter how a person thinks and acts</strong>, then Electroconvulsive therapy fulfils this criteria, and has been used to treat patients for nearly 80 years.</p>
<p>Whilst zapping brains sounds brutal (and it is) and controversial (it’s this too), it’s measurably effective: for the people suffering the most, whose symptoms resist other treatments, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy">ECT is effective 50% of the time.</a></p>
<p>Some people with disorders linked directly to the brain, like Parkinson's Disease, are already controlling their minds, and as a result, their bodies. The most well-known Parkinsonian symptom - uncontrollable shaking - can, in some people, reach an awful, unmanageable stage of constant motion that medicine alone can’t halt.</p>
<p>At this point, a deep brain implant is a scary-sounding but incredibly effective option. A Neurostimulator is implanted into the thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, or the globus pallidus, and electrical signals <a href="http://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/treatment/surgery-treatment-options/Deep-Brain-Stimulation">coax the brain into stopping the spasms.</a></p>
<p>The resulting impact is like some sort of astonishing magic:</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbX1t9dfgVE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>When you consider that the main non-physical side effect of Parkinson’s disease is also depression, it feels reasonable to consider both ECT and Deep-Brain Stimulation forms of non-benevolent mind control.</p>
<p><strong>With this in mind – <em>geddit?!</em> – you may now be able to sense how close and yet how far away we are from actively controlling minds</strong> at a functional level. Neuroscience has learnt that zapping grey matter definitely does <em>something</em>, but there’s a long way to go before we have the fuller understanding of how the brain works needed to apply those electrical signals <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602695/how-network-neuroscience-is-creating-a-new-era-of-mind-control/">in a carefully targeted way.</a></p>
<p>Think of it this way: assuming you have no idea how a computer works, if you poked around the circuit board for long enough and tested different chips with different electrical currents, eventually you’d reverse-engineer an understanding of how it works, and could make it do what you want.</p>
<p>But it’d take a long time, a lot of experiments, and a lot of broken components along the way. And with brains, you can’t replace parts you’ve fried with too many volts.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bemindful">Be Mindful</h2>
<p><strong>However, the less immediately risky area of Mind Control is the reverse:</strong> using the mind to control other things. No electrodes needed. No frazzled frontal lobes.</p>
<p>Anyone who has gnashed their teeth in frustration at not being able to type as fast as they can think, or struggled to write quickly enough on a tiny phone screen (and while we’re on this topic, let’s pour one out for  that most misunderstood and effective of homies, the Blackberry keyboard) has wondered, <em>“What if I could just think, and have all these words appear on the screen?”</em></p>
<p>Good news, of sorts, for you awaits: Facebook has an eyebrow-raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/facebook-brain-interface/">60 engineers</a> working on creating a brain-computer interface to allow exactly that, via a non-invasive interface (which means that Facebook won’t need  to drill a hole in your skull; this is a good thing.)</p>
<p>If we rewind to today, a time before we accidentally post our deepest idle thoughts to the timeline, mind control is already helping people in a profound way - such as allowing people to control their prosthetic arm by thought alone. You know, just like a real arm.</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk1NkWl_W2Y?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Of course, a major driver for any new technology is the enthusiasm of two discerning groups of people: sex toy aesthetes and video game buffs. Actually, they’re probably just one group of people.</p>
<p>Anyway - yes, of course hackers have made <a href="http://www.techthisoutnews.com/companies-explore-potential-benefits-mind-controlled-sex-toys/">mind-controlled toys a thing</a> and who wouldn’t want to play a game called <a href="http://www.latimes.com/80698976-132.html"><em>Throw Trucks With Your Mind</em></a> - but the reality is that these technologies will be best used to bring joy back to the lives of <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/gaming-improves-multitasking-skills-1.13674">elderly or less able people</a>.</p>
<p>Certain video games improve mental cognition, and when the controls become the brain itself, playing games becomes even more directly useful.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whereismymind">Where is my mind???</h2>
<p><strong>And here, finally, is where we reach a state of meta-mind-control:</strong> technology that we control with our minds to enable us to control our minds. Essentially, the Emotiv Muse headset is a $300 gizmo that lets you know when you’ve achieved a calm, meditative state by making <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3036390/how-i-wore-a-brainwave-reading-headset-for-a-week-and-learned-to-calm-my-mind">chirruping bird noises at you via a connected app.</a></p>
<p>And yet, anyone who has stumbled through the agonisingly slow <em>fail-fail-fail-momentary-success!-fail</em> process of learning to meditate would take pause to consider the usefulness of a headset that helps you become more mindful.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Perhaps the story of mind control technology doesn’t deliver</strong> the salacious ending you might secretly hope for - you won’t be using your <a href="https://getgrover.com/de-de/phones-and-tablets/smartphones">iPhone</a> to turn people into pliant slaves any time soon - but it does offer hope of a near future where the mind can be hacked, tweaked and soothed to help those who need it most.</p>
<p>OK, that’s boring, I know. Here’s a mind-controlled drone. Wheeeeeee!</p>
