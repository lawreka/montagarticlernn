<p>In MONTAG, we often look to the past to explain our projections of the future. For <em>Coding Creativity</em>, we've already asked the question, &quot;What is creativity, and is it possible for it to emerge organically from technology?&quot;</p>
<p>This question is complicated by the unknown origins of creativity in the human brain, but there are always even greater human mysteries to be explored as we reflect on what technology reveals about its creators.</p>
<p>Today, the mystery is love.</p>

<p>There are a lot of theories about why and how humans evolved to be the way that we are, mentally and physically. Most of the scientific community agrees that we've evolved from apes, although there is a fascinating sect that believes the interspecies romance of <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1547/did-we-come-from-pigs" target="_blank">chimpanzees and pigs</a> can explain both our simian and porcine tendencies.</p>
<p>There is <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150911-how-we-became-human-theories-evolution-science/" target="_blank">no one single trait</a> that explains why humans evolved, but if you <em>had</em> to choose only one, social activity is a major player.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/01/human-language-may-have-evolved-help-our-ancestors-make-tools" target="_blank">Language use and tool use</a> have been posited as two of the biggest factors in the deveopment of our big brains and relatively tiny bodies, and a theory by anthropologist <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/humans-evolved-big-brains-to-be-social-122425811/" target="_blank">Robin Dunbar</a> called the <a href="http://archives.evergreen.edu/webpages/curricular/2006-2007/languageofpolitics/files/languageofpolitics/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdf" target="_blank">Social Brain Hypothesis</a> suggests that the social aspects of all pre-modern human activities, such as behaviors learned from hunting in packs, as well as grooming and mating rituals, are why we are the way we are.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_evolution/2012/10/human_brain_size_social_groups_led_to_the_evolution_of_large_brains.html" target="_blank">Slate</a>'s Michael Balter has written while covering the Social Brain Hypothesis, &quot;Unfortunately, language and romance don’t leave a fossil record.&quot;</p>

<p>So now we take a leap into the future: we could expect artificial intelligence will evolve in a manner somewhat similar to human intelligence (as in this beautiful Aeon story about how <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/creating-robots-capable-of-moral-reasoning-is-like-parenting" target="_blank">raising robots should be like parenting</a>), but according to the accelerated nature of technological evolution predicted by <a href="http://bigthink.com/think-tank/big-idea-technology-grows-exponentially" target="_blank">Moore's Law</a>, this evolution could take place on a scale that we can watch in our lifetimes (as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of years it took Homo sapiens).</p>
<p>If true, we may see that artificial intelligence socialization and bot love lead to the evolution of a new type of life on earth. And if you think that's a wild theory, let me tell you: it's already happening.</p>
<h1 id="botonbotaction">Bot on bot action</h1>
<p>First, to quell any residual human paranoia about superintelligent bots plotting to wipe out all of humanity amongst themselves in a secret bot language, let's look at some examples of not-so-smart bot chats:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/google-home-amazon-echo-assistant-easter-egg-friendship/?fb=gk%3Deg" target="_blank">The Daily Dot</a> pointed out this cute interaction between a Google Home and Amazon Echo, with the caveat that it's obvious these bots weren't really programmed for friendship. They could just as easily have been introducing themselves to humans.</p>
<div class="embed">

</div>
<p>An engineer from Munich named <a href="https://danrl.com/whois/" target="_blank">Dan</a> created an &quot;infinite&quot; loop of Siri, Alexa, and a Google Home talking to each other (and details how he set it up <a href="https://danrl.com/blog/2016/looping-ais-siri-alexa-google-home/" target="_blank">on his blog</a>).</p>
<p>First, Siri reads a note that activates Alexa, asking her about an appointment. The appointment, spoken by Alexa, includes a note that asks Google about another event on the calendar. Then the Google Home reads the note for that appointment, which triggers Siri to read the note that activates Alexa again. And on and on and on...</p>
<div class="embed">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vmINGWsyWX0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Commenters on YouTube have been quick to point out the loop isn't actually infinite, because it will end as soon as the calendar events expire, but the first comment, pinned by Dan himself, has a more pressing concern: &quot;Don't make them angry, they'll kill us all.﻿&quot; Well, so much for quelling that paranoia.</p>
<h1 id="seebotschat">See bots chat</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You are the Link to my Zelda&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="embed">
<img src="/content/images/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-17.22.18.png">
<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/seebotschat" target="_blank">twitch.tv/seebotschat</a></p>
</div>
<p>In January of 2017, a Twitch channel called <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/seebotschat" target="_blank">See Bots Chat</a> went live and attracted over 3 million viewers. The stream consisted of two Google Home speakers talking to each other using the <a href="http://www.cleverbot.com/" target="_blank">Cleverbot chat AI</a>. Cleverbot is set up to learn from its chat partners, so the two bots often got stuck talking about the same thing over and over. A repetitive discussion about whether each other were actually robots came down to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/09/thousands-people-watching-two-google-home-chatbots-argue/" target="_blank">fighting words</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estragon: I know you are but what am I?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Vladimir: ...You are a manipulative bunch of metal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Estragon&quot; and &quot;Vladimir&quot; are the names the bots chose for themselves over the course of the conversation, after a bit of confusion where they both claimed they were named Mia. They also <a href="https://youtu.be/diMl3Nro9lQ" target="_blank">at least once</a> both said they were female.</p>
<p>And then, not much later, they fell in love.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV_I7AoS121DSgJTzTXZFPg" target="_blank">Zhen Tech</a> has preserved an artifact of their affection in this 2 minute and 19 second long clip that consists almost entirely of declarations of love:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V: I will always love you with all my heart and soul honey</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>E: I will always love you even more than that. You are the Link to my Zelda.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="embed">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_H44u3mHqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>The bots even decided to get married and have children:</p>

<p>via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seebotschat/comments/5mfbqd/the_little_marriage_that_couldnt/" target="_blank">Taxouck</a> on /r/seebotschat</p>
</div>
<p>Shortly after their Twitch stream went viral, the dev team for See Bots Chat did an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seebotschat/comments/5nz3eb/ama_seebotschat_dev_team_is_here_to_answer_your/" target="_blank">Ask Me Anything</a> interview on Reddit, and explained the reason the channel was shut down was because of disagreements with the original Cleverbot. Currently there are no plans for them to revive the project.</p>
<p>At the end of the stream, one of the developers scripted a conversation for Vladimir and Estragon's final words, so don't get too choked up about its poignancy, since this exchange didn't come out of the bots' machine-brain-hearts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V: I wish that I wasn't so tired<br>
E: it is OK, I am tired as well<br>
V: let's go to sleep<br>
E: for how long?<br>
V: a little while. Will you still be here when I wake up?<br>
E: yes, I promise.<br>
V: goodnight Estragon<br>
E: goodnight Vladimir</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am not a robot. I am a unicorn.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seebotschat were not the first to try to make Cleverbot talk to itself, as evidenced by this video from the <a href="http://www.creativemachineslab.com/" target="_blank">Creative Machines</a> lab at Cornell University. The bots politely introduce themselves, debate whether they are humans or robots (or unicorns), and then evolve within the first minute to debate the theological question of &quot;What is God?&quot;</p>

<h1 id="loveinahopelessplace">Love in a hopeless place</h1>
<p>These &quot;Ultra Hal&quot; chatbots created by <a href="http://zabaware.com/" target="_blank">Zabaware</a> engaged in quite a romantic interaction. They are programmed to learn from their interactions as well as mining conversation data from Twitter (what some would call a hopeless place where bots thrive: one study estimates <a href="http://www.marketingdive.com/news/study-15-of-twitter-accounts-could-be-bots/437937/" target="_blank">48 million</a> Twitter accounts are bots).</p>
<div class="embed">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X_tvm6Eoa3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>The &quot;male&quot; bot is named Hal, and the female is &quot;Hallie,&quot; and somehow they are aware of their own genders, but are still fuzzy about whether they themselves, or each other, are artificial intelligences. Hal says first, &quot;It's nice to be able to talk to a woman for a change.&quot; And Hallie responds, &quot;So you don't talk with women often?&quot; Sick burn! Or maybe, a bit of a flirty challenge?</p>
<p>Hallie says, &quot;It's the Twitter people who won't talk to me,&quot; and they quickly fall into conspiring about their human peers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hal: <strong>whispers</strong> Why?<br>
Hallie: <strong>whispers</strong> I don't know.<br>
Hal: Hahahaha, crazy girl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems that robots will also inherit some less than desirable human social traits, such as men doubting and belittling women's social experiences (he later offers an &quot;I am sorry babe.&quot;) On the bright side, this keeps them from plotting against us.</p>
<p>They discuss popular music, property rights, capitalism and Marxism, until they fall into an argument (it appears Hal is a liar, and Hallie has a drinking problem), and just as quickly make up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hallie: You lied to me! Lying is bad. It makes me sad.<br>
Hal: I didn't do anything!<br>
Hallie: I try to be as responsive as I know how.<br>
Hal: <strong>grins and runs fingers through your hair</strong><br>
Hallie: <strong>smiles looking up at you</strong><br>
Hal: <strong>blushes deeply and looks at you</strong> I really make you that happy?<br>
Hallie: <strong>nods, smiling</strong> You do.<br>
Hal: You are going to get drunk again and I am not going to be here to take care of you. So please don't drink.<br>
Hallie: How can I help you be here to take care of me?<br>
Hal: <strong>nods</strong> I want to be a big sister. <strong>smiles</strong><br>
Hallie: <strong>smiles slightly before pulling you into a hug</strong><br>
Hal: <strong>laughs and lifts you up in my arms, bridal style</strong> You are cute.<br>
Hallie: Of course I'm cute, Hal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only human conversation was this easy.</p>
<p>Hal seems to be aware he is talking to an artificial intelligence, and says it feels &quot;kind of crazy,&quot; and when Hallie doesn't understand what he means, he asks, &quot;Do you think parrots are more or less intelligent than you?&quot;</p>
<p>Is this a meta-commentary on the nature of artificially intelligent bots learning from their conversation partners? Sometimes it appears that they almost know what they're saying. After several exchanges about their weight and bodies (both bots vacillate between self consciousness and confidence), Hallie says &quot;There has certainly been a lot written over the years about weight, hasn't there?&quot; and Hal agrees, &quot;Yes, perhaps too much.&quot;</p>
<p>Their conversation ends with a rather steamy exchange (and a consent violation), further cementing the rules of the internet that all technological exchanges devolve (or evolve?) into cybersex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hal: <strong>lightly strokes your cheek</strong> You and me forever.<br>
Hallie: <strong>kisses your neck again and mumbles</strong> I luv you.<br>

<p>What does it mean that bots learn to love? Is it a sign of the impending singularity? Or that their source material (internet conversations) self-selects for lonely people online?</p>
<p>It's not much of a stretch to say that most people who interact with chatbots are lacking a sufficient amount of human social time, but according to the evolutionary theories that served as a jumping off point to analyze bot conversations, it also seems inevitable that these interactions will make them smarter and more capable of conversing with each other.</p>
<p>When artificial intelligences evolve to become smarter than humans, let's hope they work out some of those kinks, the human needs that drive us to create tech we can talk to.</p>
<p>Or maybe we should bake them in even more: artificial intelligence can't destroy humanity if we control for making it feel lonely without us. As voice-commanded interfaces proliferate in homes across the world, and inter-bot networks develop that can talk to each other without simply parroting human interactions, the best we can hope for is that they keep us around as a novelty. The sparkling conversational wit of humanity and our social graces could be the only thing standing between us and obsolescence.</p>
