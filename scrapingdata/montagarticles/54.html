          <p>One of the eye-opening consequences of using a <a href="https://getgrover.com/de/categories/wearables#view_all">fitness tracker</a> or <a href="https://getgrover.com/de/categories/apple-watch#view_all">Apple Watch</a> to monitor your heart rate is realising that even a seemingly innocuous drug like alcohol has a clear measurable effect on your body: average heart rates ebb and flow in line with consumption (and subsequent hangover.)</p>
<p>Where once the idea of &quot;drugs&quot; was seedy and tainted with criminality, today, a combination of very open data sharing, a willingness to experiment in a  less hedonistic way, and the ease with which one can buy <em>anything</em> anonymously on the dark web, means that not only is drug-taking approached differently, but there are many new drugs to take.</p>
<p>Kathryn Lawrence takes a look at how old drugs are being used in new ways, and how future drugs may be used less as a way to <em>get out of it</em>, and more as a route to get something more out of life...</p>

<p>Huey Lewis had nothing on the latest technology to make you feel strange.</p>
<p>What he wanted, a drug that makes him feel like he feels &quot;alone with you,&quot; can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine" target="_blank">phenethylamine</a>, a nervous system stimulant that is also known as the &quot;Love Drug,&quot; and is thought to be one of the chemical reasons (along with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carmendrahl/2017/02/14/theobromine-chocolate-chemistry-valentines/#2828b2fe59fc" target="_blank">theobromine</a>) that chocolate gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling.</p>
<p>The 1991 and 1997 books PiHKAL and TiHKAL, (acronyms for Phenethylamines and Tryptomines I Have Known And Loved) are still considered the bibles of drug synthesis.</p>
<p>Published by biochemist and psychopharmacologist <a href="http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/" target="_blank">Alexander Shulgin</a>, and co-written with his wife Ann, they illustrate the processes of creating such now well-known compounds as MDMA, DMT, Mescaline, Melatonin, and LSD, as well as lesser-known synthetic psychedelics in the 2C family.</p>
<p>Both Shulgins were pioneers in the use of psychedelics for therapy and in publishing these books have &quot;open-sourced&quot; psychedelic drug research.</p>
<p>But what do these drugs have to do with future tech?</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/25/technology/kottke-lsd-steve-jobs/index.html" target="_blank">Steve Jobs dropped acid at Reed College</a> in the 70s, people have been associating industry-disrupting vision with drug-induced cognitive enhancement.</p>

<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/lsd-microdosing-is-trending-in-silicon-valley-but-can-it-actually-make-you-more-creative-72747" target="_blank">Microdosing LSD</a> has recently become popular in the tech community: that is, taking 20 micrograms or less of lysergic acid, below the psychedelic threshold, so as to experience the creative and energy boosting effects of the drug – without the often debilitating or at least workday-derailing hallucinatory effects.</p>
<p>However, because LSD and other psychedelic drugs are largely illegal to manufacture and sell, studies on their long- and short-term beneficial use have been limited. Organizations such as <a href="http://www.maps.org/" target="_blank">MAPS</a>, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, advocate for and sponsor scientific research into the therapeutic use of marijuana, MDMA, and LSD.</p>
<p>But the lack of research doesn't seem to be stopping people from trying it, as new stories continue to amass anecdotal evidence from <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-to-lsd-microdose" target="_blank">anonymous Silicon Valley entrepreneurs</a>, groups of <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mgy573/400-people-microdosed-lsd-for-a-month-in-the-name-of-science" target="_blank">over 400 volunteers</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15403644/microdosing-lsd-acid-productivity-benefits-brain-studies" target="_blank">a 64-year-old psychotherapist</a>, and journalists from <a href="http://www.marieclaire.co.za/lifestyle/microdosing-lsd-for-a-month" target="_blank">Marie Claire</a> to the <a href="http://www.wweek.com/culture/2017/04/18/i-tried-microdosing-with-four-different-psychedelic-drugs-heres-what-happened/" target="_blank">Willamette Week</a>.</p>
<p>Even podcasters are getting into it: enjoy episode #44 of Gimlet Media's show &quot;Reply All,&quot; if you want to hear people suprised that being high on LSD at work isn't a comfortable experience:</p>

<h2 id="thefuturefreaksmeout">The Future Freaks Me Out</h2>
<p>We can always turn to science fiction to predict the highs and lows, the uppers and the downers, of the future. Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_medicines_and_drugs" target="_blank">list of fictional medicines and drugs</a> provides a comprehensive look into ways authors have imagined how we'll want to feel different, and notes that fictional drugs, <em>&quot;are often included by authors to create or to reduce the utopian/ideal nature of their fictional world and to introduce harsh realism and dystopia.&quot;</em></p>
<p>So here's a short list of fictional drugs that, based on today's trends, we might expect future chemists to take a stab at synthesizing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;DMZ&quot; from <em>Infinite Jest</em>: &quot;Powerful hallucinogen derived from a species of mold.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New drugs made from previously-undiscovered fungi have been discovered as recently as June of 2017, according to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170612115410.htm" target="_blank">Science Daily.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Electricity&quot; from <em>Futurama</em>: &quot;While electricity is real, it is often abused by robots in the year 3000, and its effects seem to be psychedelic, with withdrawal symptoms of paranoia.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/10/can-robots-be-creative" target="_blank">whether robots can become truly intelligent and exhibit creativity</a> is already being asked, so why shouldn't we think that artificial intelligences won't also seek psychedelic experiences?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bananadine&quot; from <em>The Anarchist's Cookbook</em> and &quot;Leeches&quot; from <em>Above The Influence</em>: A joke or hoax psychoactive drug extracted from banana peels and an activity called &quot;SLOMming&quot; (standing for &quot;Sticking Leeches On Myself&quot;) was depicted as being popular with high-school students looking to get high.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:100%;text-align:center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AXcCnKh1jzs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%;"></iframe>
</div>
<p>Both these fictional drugs caused people to actually try them in real life (yes, teens really did start sticking leeches on themselves thanks to a poorly constructed metaphor in an anti-drug PSA). But who knows, maybe some day a joke drug could unexpectedly prove to actually work.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Until we all have microchips in our brains</strong>, or spend the majority of our time in virtual realities, we probably won't have drugs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TekWar" target="_blank">Tek</a> (an illegal, addictive, mind-altering digital drug in the form of a microchip) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash" target="_blank">Snow Crash</a> (which exists as both a computer virus and a hallucinogenic drug) but given that both of those advancements in technology are well on their way, it could be only a matter of time before microdosing LSD is as simple as running LSD.exe.</p>
